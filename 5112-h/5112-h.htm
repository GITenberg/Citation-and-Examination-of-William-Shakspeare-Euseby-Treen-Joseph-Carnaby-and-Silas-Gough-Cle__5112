<h2>EDITOR&rsquo;S PREFACE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">It</span> was an
ancestor of my husband who <i>brought out</i> the famous
Shakspeare.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words were really spoken, and were repeated in
conversation as most ridiculous.&nbsp; Certainly such was very
far from the lady&rsquo;s intention; and who knows to what extent
they are true?</p>
<p>The frolic of Shakspeare in deer-stealing was the cause of his
<i>Hegira</i>; and his connection with players in London was the
cause of his writing plays.&nbsp; Had he remained in his native
town, his ambition had never been excited by the applause of the
intellectual, the popular, and the powerful, which, after all,
was hardly sufficient to excite it.&nbsp; He wrote from the same
motive as he acted,&mdash;to earn his daily bread.&nbsp; He felt
his own powers; but he cared little for making them felt by
others more than served his wants.</p>
<p>The malignant may doubt, or pretend to doubt, the authenticity
of the <i>Examination</i> here published.&nbsp; Let us, who are
not malignant, be cautious of adding anything to the noisome mass
of incredulity that surrounds us; let us avoid the crying sin of
our age, in which the &ldquo;Memoirs of a Parish Clerk,&rdquo;
edited as they were by a pious and learned dignitary of the
Established Church, are questioned in regard to their
genuineness; and even the privileges of Parliament are inadequate
to cover from the foulest imputation&mdash;the imputation of
having exercised his inventive faculties&mdash;the elegant and
accomplished editor of Eugene Aram&rsquo;s apprehension, trial,
and defence.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is little of real history, excepting in
romances.&nbsp; Some of these are strictly true to nature; while
histories in general give a distorted view of her, and rarely a
faithful record either of momentous or of common events.</p>
<p>Examinations taken from the mouth are surely the most
trustworthy.&nbsp; Whoever doubts it may be convinced by Ephraim
Barnett.</p>
<p>The Editor is confident he can give no offence to any person
who may happen to bear the name of Lucy.&nbsp; The family of Sir
Thomas became extinct nearly half a century ago, and the estates
descended to the Rev. Mr. John Hammond, of Jesus College, in
Oxford, a respectable Welsh curate, between whom and him there
existed at his birth eighteen prior claimants.&nbsp; He took the
name of Lucy.</p>
<p>The reader will form to himself, from this &ldquo;Examination
of Shakspeare,&rdquo; more favourable opinion of Sir Thomas than
is left upon his mind by the dramatist in the character of
Justice Shallow.&nbsp; The knight, indeed, is here exhibited in
all his pride of birth and station, in all his pride of
theologian and poet; he is led by the nose, while he believes
that nobody can move him, and shows some other weaknesses, which
the least attentive observer will discover; but he is not without
a little kindness at the bottom of the heart,&mdash;a heart too
contracted to hold much, or to let what it holds ebulliate very
freely.&nbsp; But, upon the whole, we neither can utterly hate
nor utterly despise him.&nbsp; Ungainly as he is.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Circum pr&aelig;cordia
ludit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author of the &ldquo;Imaginary Conversations&rdquo; seems,
in his &ldquo;Boccacio and Petrarca,&rdquo; to have taken his
idea of <i>Sir Magnus</i> from this manuscript.&nbsp; He,
however, has adapted that character to the times; and in <i>Sir
Magnus</i> the coward rises to the courageous, the unskilful in
arms becomes the skilful, and war is to him a teacher of
humanity.&nbsp; With much superstition, theology never molests
him; scholarship and poetry are no affairs of his.&nbsp; He
doubts of himself and others, and is as suspicious in his
ignorance as Sir Thomas is confident.</p>
<p>With these wide diversities, there are family features, such
as are likely to display themselves in different times and
circumstances, and some so generically prevalent as never to lie
quite dormant in the breed.&nbsp; In both of them there is
parsimony, there is arrogance, there is contempt of inferiors,
there is abject awe of power, there is irresolution, there is
imbecility.&nbsp; But Sir Magnus has no knowledge, and no respect
for it.&nbsp; Sir Thomas would almost go thirty miles, even to
Oxford, to see a fine specimen of it, although, like most of
those who call themselves the godly, he entertains the most
undoubting belief that he is competent to correct the errors of
the wisest and most practised theologian.</p>
<h2>EDITOR&rsquo;S APOLOGY.</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">part</span> only of the many
deficiencies which the reader will discover in this book is
attributable to the Editor.&nbsp; These, however, it is his duty
to account for, and he will do it as briefly as he can.</p>
<p>The <i>fac-similes</i> (as printers&rsquo; boys call them,
meaning <i>specimens</i>) of the handwriting of nearly all the
persons introduced, might perhaps have been procured had
sufficient time been allowed for another journey into
Warwickshire.&nbsp; That of Shakspeare is known already in the
signature to his will, but deformed by sickness; that of Sir
Thomas Lucy is extant at the bottom of a commitment of a female
vagrant, for having a sucking child in her arms on the public
road; that of Silas Gough is affixed to the register of births
and marriages, during several years, in the parishes of Hampton
Lucy and Charlecote, and certifies one death,&mdash;Euseby
Treen&rsquo;s; surmised, at least, to be his by the letters
&ldquo;E. T.&rdquo; cut on a bench seven inches thick, under an
old pollard-oak outside the park paling of Charlecote, toward the
northeast.&nbsp; For this discovery the Editor is indebted to a
most respectable, intelligent farmer in the adjoining parish of
Wasperton, in which parish Treen&rsquo;s elder brother lies
buried.&nbsp; The worthy farmer is unwilling to accept the large
portion of fame justly due to him for the services he has thus
rendered to literature in elucidating the history of Shakspeare
and his times.&nbsp; In possession of another agricultural
gentleman there was recently a very curious piece of iron,
believed by many celebrated antiquaries to have constituted a
part of a knight&rsquo;s breast-plate.&nbsp; It was purchased for
two hundred pounds by the trustees of the British Museum, among
whom, the reader will be grieved to hear, it produced dissension
and coldness; several of them being of opinion that it was merely
a gorget, while others were inclined to the belief that it was
the forepart of a horse-shoe.&nbsp; The Committee of Taste and
the Heads of the Arch&aelig;ological Society were
consulted.&nbsp; These learned, dispassionate, and benevolent men
had the satisfaction of conciliating the parties at
variance,&mdash;each having yielded somewhat and every member
signing, and affixing his seal to the signature, that, if indeed
it be the forepart of a horse-shoe, it was probably
Ismael&rsquo;s,&mdash;there being a curved indentation along it,
resembling the first letter of his name, and there being no
certainty or record that he died in France, or was left in that
country by Sir Magnus.</p>
<p>The Editor is unable to render adequate thanks to the Rev.
Stephen Turnover for the gratification he received in his curious
library by a sight of Joseph Carnaby&rsquo;s name at full length,
in red ink, coming from a trumpet in the mouth of an angel.&nbsp;
This invaluable document is upon an engraving in a frontispiece
to the New Testament.&nbsp; But since unhappily he could procure
no signature of Hannah Hathaway, nor of her mother, and only a
questionable one of Mr. John Shakspeare, the poet&rsquo;s
father,&mdash;there being two, in two very different
hands,&mdash;both he and the publisher were of opinion that the
graphical part of the volume would be justly censured as
extremely incomplete, and that what we could give would only
raise inextinguishable regret for that which we could not.&nbsp;
On this reflection all have been omitted.</p>
<p>The Editor is unwilling to affix any mark of disapprobation on
the very clever engraver who undertook the sorrel mare; but as in
the memorable words of that ingenious gentleman from Ireland
whose polished and elaborate epigrams raised him justly to the
rank of prime minister,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;White was not
<i>so very</i> white,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in like manner it appeared to nearly all the artists he
consulted that the sorrel mare was not <i>so sorrel</i> in
print.</p>
<p>There is another and a graver reason why the Editor was
induced to reject the contribution of his friend the engraver;
and this is, a neglect of the late improvements in his art, he
having, unadvisedly or thoughtlessly, drawn in the old-fashioned
manner lines at the two sides and at the top and bottom of his
print, confining it to such limits as paintings are confined in
by their frames.&nbsp; Our spirited engravers, it is well-known,
disdain this thraldom, and not only give unbounded space to their
scenery, but also melt their figures in the air,&mdash;so
advantageously, that, for the most part, they approach the
condition of cherubs.&nbsp; This is the true a&euml;rial
perspective, so little understood heretofore.&nbsp; Trees,
castles, rivers, volcanoes, oceans, float together in absolute
vacancy; the solid earth is represented, what we know it actually
is, buoyant as a bubble, so that no wonder if every horse is
endued with all the privileges of Pegasus, save and except our
sorrel.&nbsp; Malicious carpers, insensible or invidious of
England&rsquo;s glory, deny her in this beautiful practice the
merit of invention, assigning it to the Chinese in their tea-cups
and saucers; but if not absolutely new and ours, it must be
acknowledged that we have greatly improved and extended the
invention.</p>
<p>Such are the reasons why the little volume here laid before
the public is defective in those decorations which the exalted
state of literature demands.&nbsp; Something of compensation is
supplied by a Memorandum of Ephraim Barnett, written upon the
inner cover, and printed below.</p>
<p>The Editor, it will be perceived, is but little practised in
the ways of literature; much less is he gifted with that
prophetic spirit which can anticipate the judgment of the
public.&nbsp; It may be that he is too idle or too apathetic to
think anxiously or much about the matter; and yet he has been
amused, in his earlier days, at watching the first appearance of
such few books as he believed to be the production of some
powerful intellect.&nbsp; He has seen people slowly rise up to
them, like carp in a pond when food is thrown into it; some of
which carp snatch suddenly at a morsel, and swallow it; others
touch it gently with their barb, pass deliberately by, and leave
it; others wriggle and rub against it more disdainfully; others,
in sober truth, know not what to make of it, swim round and round
it, eye it on the sunny side, eye it on the shady, approach it,
question it, shoulder it, flap it with the tail, turn it over,
look askance at it, take a pea-shell or a worm instead of it, and
plunge again their heads into the comfortable mud.&nbsp; After
some seasons the same food will suit their stomachs better.</p>
<h2>EXAMINATION,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ETC., ETC.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> one hour before noontide the
youth <span class="smcap">William Shakspeare</span>, accused of
deer-stealing, and apprehended for that offence, was brought into
the great hall at Charlecote, where, having made his obeisance,
it was most graciously permitted him to stand.</p>
<p>The worshipful Sir Thomas Lucy, Knight, seeing him right
opposite, on the farther side of the long table, and fearing no
disadvantage, did frown upon him with great dignity; then,
deigning ne&rsquo;er a word to the culprit, turned he his face
toward his chaplain, Sir Silas Gough, who stood beside him, and
said unto him most courteously, and unlike unto one who in his
own right commandeth,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand out of the way!&nbsp; What are those two varlets
bringing into the room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The table, sir,&rdquo; replied Master Silas,
&ldquo;upon the which the consumption of the venison was
perpetrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth, William Shakspeare, did thereupon pray and beseech
his lordship most fervently, in this guise:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir! do not let him turn the tables against me, who
am only a simple stripling, and he an old codger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Master Silas did bite his nether lip, and did cry
aloud,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look upon those deadly spots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And his worship did look thereupon most staidly, and did say
in the ear of Master Silas, but in such wise that it reached even
unto mine,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good honest chandlery, methinks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant it may turn out so!&rdquo; ejaculated Master
Silas.</p>
<p>The youth, hearing these words, said unto him,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear, Master Silas, gentry like you often pray God to
grant what <i>he</i> would rather not; and now and then what
<i>you</i> would rather not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Silas was wroth at this rudeness of speech about God in
the face of a preacher, and said, reprovingly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out upon thy foul mouth, knave! upon which lie
slaughter and venison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon did William Shakspeare sit mute awhile, and
discomfited; then turning toward Sir Thomas, and looking and
speaking as one submiss and contrite, he thus appealed unto
him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worshipful sir! were there any signs of venison on my
mouth, Master Silas could not for his life cry out upon it, nor
help kissing it as &rsquo;twere a wench&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas looked upon him with most lordly gravity and
wisdom, and said unto him, in a voice that might have come from
the bench:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Youth, thou speakest irreverently;&rdquo; and then unto
Master Silas: &ldquo;Silas! to the business on hand.&nbsp; Taste
the fat upon yon boor&rsquo;s table, which the constable hath
brought hither, good Master Silas!&nbsp; And declare upon oath,
being sworn in my presence, first, whether said fat do proceed of
venison; secondly, whether said venison be of buck or
doe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon the reverend Sir Silas did go incontinently, and did
bend forward his head, shoulders, and body, and did severally
taste four white solid substances upon an oaken board; said board
being about two yards long, and one yard four inches
wide,&mdash;found in, and brought thither from, the tenement or
messuage of Andrew Haggit, who hath absconded.&nbsp; Of these
four white solid substances, two were somewhat larger than a
groat, and thicker; one about the size of King Henry the
Eighth&rsquo;s shilling, when our late sovereign lord of blessed
memory was toward the lustiest; and the other, that is to say the
middlemost, did resemble in some sort, a mushroom, not over
fresh, turned upward on its stalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what sayest thou, Master Silas?&rdquo; quoth the
knight.</p>
<p>In reply whereunto Sir Silas thus averred:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Venison! o&rsquo; my conscience!<br />
Buck! or burn me alive!</p>
<p>The three splashes in the circumference are verily and indeed
venison; buck, moreover,&mdash;and Charlecote buck, upon my
oath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then carefully tasting the protuberance in the centre, he spat
it out, crying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pho</i>! <i>pho</i>! <i>villain</i>!
<i>villain</i>!&rdquo; and shaking his fist at the culprit.</p>
<p>Whereat the said culprit smiled and winked, and said
off-hand,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save thy spittle, Silas!&nbsp; It would supply a gaudy
mess to the hungriest litter; but it would turn them from whelps
into wolvets.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is pity to throw the best of thee
away.&nbsp; Nothing comes out of thy mouth that is not savoury
and solid, bating thy wit, thy sermons, and thy
promises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was my duty to write down the very words, irreverent as
they are, being so commanded.&nbsp; More of the like, it is to be
feared, would have ensued, but that Sir Thomas did check him,
saying, shrewdly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man!&nbsp; I perceive that if I do not stop thee
in thy courses, thy name, being involved in thy company&rsquo;s,
may one day or other reach across the county; and folks may
handle it and turn it about, as it deserveth, from Coleshill to
Nuneaton, from Bromwicham to Brownsover.&nbsp; And who knoweth
but that, years after thy death, the very house wherein thou wert
born may be pointed at, and commented on, by knots of people,
gentle and simple!&nbsp; What a shame for an honest man&rsquo;s
son!&nbsp; Thanks to me, who consider of measures to prevent
it!&nbsp; Posterity shall laud and glorify me for plucking thee
clean out of her head, and for picking up timely a ticklish
skittle, that might overthrow with it a power of others just as
light.&nbsp; I will rid the hundred of thee, with God&rsquo;s
blessing!&mdash;nay, the whole shire.&nbsp; We will have none
such in our county; we justices are agreed upon it, and we will
keep our word now and forevermore.&nbsp; Woe betide any that
resembles thee in any part of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereunto Sir Silas added,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will dog him, and worry him, and haunt him, and
bedevil him; and if ever he hear a comfortable word, it shall be
in a language very different from his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As different as thine is from a
Christian&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! thou art slow of apprehension,&rdquo; said Sir
Thomas, with much gravity; and taking up the cue, did
rejoin,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Silas would impress upon thy ductile and tender
mind the danger of evil doing; that we, in other words that
justice is resolved to follow him up, even beyond his country,
where he shall hear nothing better than the Italian or the
Spanish, or the black language, or the language of Turk or
Troubadour, or Tartar or Mongol.&nbsp; And, forsooth, for this
gentle and indirect reproof, a gentleman in priest&rsquo;s orders
is told by a stripling that he lacketh Christianity!&nbsp; Who
then shall give it?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, indeed? when the founder of the feast leaveth an
invited guest so empty!&nbsp; Yea, sir, the guest was invited,
and the board was spread.&nbsp; The fruits that lay upon it be
there still, and fresh as ever; and the bread of life in those
capacious canisters is unconsumed and unbroken.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span> (<i>aside</i>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The knave maketh me hungry with his mischievous
similitudes.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast aggravated thy offence, Wil Shakspeare!&nbsp;
Irreverent caitiff! is this a discourse for my chaplain and
clerk?&nbsp; Can he or the worthy scribe Ephraim (his worship was
pleased to call me worthy) write down such words as those, about
litter and wolvets, for the perusal and meditation of the grand
jury?&nbsp; If the whole corporation of Stratford had not
unanimously given it against thee, still his tongue would catch
thee, as the evet catcheth a gnat.&nbsp; Know, sirrah, the
reverend Sir Silas, albeit ill appointed for riding, and not
over-fond of it, goeth to every house wherein is a venison feast
for thirty miles round.&nbsp; Not a buck&rsquo;s hoof on any
stable-door but it awakeneth his recollections like a red
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This wholesome reproof did bring the youth back again to his
right senses; and then said he, with contrition, and with a
wisdom beyond his years, and little to be expected from one who
had spoken just before so unadvisedly and rashly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well do I know it, your worship!&nbsp; And verily do I
believe that a bone of one being shovelled among the soil upon
his coffin would forthwith quicken <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a> him.&nbsp; Sooth to
say, there is ne&rsquo;er a buckhound in the county but he
treateth him as a godchild, patting him on the head, soothing his
velvety ear between thumb and forefinger, ejecting tick from
tenement, calling him &lsquo;fine fellow,&rsquo; &lsquo;noble
lad,&rsquo; and giving him his blessing, as one dearer to him
than a king&rsquo;s debt to a debtor, <a name="citation8b"></a><a
href="#footnote8b" class="citation">[8b]</a> or a bastard to a
dad of eighty.&nbsp; This is the only kindness I ever heard of
Master Silas toward his fellow-creatures.&nbsp; Never hold me
unjust, Sir Knight, to Master Silas.&nbsp; Could I learn other
good of him, I would freely say it; for we do good by speaking
it, and none is easier.&nbsp; Even bad men are not bad men while
they praise the just.&nbsp; Their first step backward is more
troublesome and wrenching to them than the first
forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, where did he gather all
this?&rdquo; whispered his worship to the chaplain, by whose side
I was sitting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, he talks like a man of
forty-seven, or more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt his sincerity, sir!&rdquo; replied the
chaplain.&nbsp; &ldquo;His words are fairer now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil choke him for them!&rdquo; interjected he, with
an undervoice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and almost book-worthy; but out of place.&nbsp;
What the scurvy cur yelped against me, I forgive him as a
Christian.&nbsp; Murrain upon such varlet vermin!&nbsp; It is but
of late years that dignities have come to be reviled.&nbsp; The
other parts of the Gospel were broken long before,&mdash;this was
left us; and now this likewise is to be kicked out of doors, amid
the mutterings of such mooncalves as him yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too true, Silas!&rdquo; said the knight, sighing
deeply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Things are not as they were in our glorious
wars of York and Lancaster.&nbsp; The knaves were thinned
then,&mdash;two or three crops a year of that rank squitch-grass
which it has become the fashion of late to call the people.&nbsp;
There was some difference then between buff doublets and iron
mail, and the rogues felt it.&nbsp; Well-a-day! we must bear what
God willeth, and never repine, although it gives a man the
heart-ache.&nbsp; We are bound in duty to keep these things for
the closet, and to tell God of them only when we call upon his
holy name, and have him quite by ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Silas looked discontented and impatient, and said,
snappishly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast we off here, or we shall be at fault.&nbsp; Start
him, sir!&mdash;prithee, start him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again his worship, Sir Thomas, did look gravely and grandly,
and taking a scrap of paper out of the Holy Book then lying
before him, did read distinctly these words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providence hath sent Master Silas back hither, this
morning, to confound thee in thy guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, with all the courage and composure of an innocent man,
and indeed with more than what an innocent man ought to possess
in the presence of a magistrate, the youngster said, pointing
toward Master Silas,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first moment he ventureth to lift up his visage
from the table, hath Providence marked him miraculously.&nbsp; I
have heard of black malice.&nbsp; How many of our words have more
in them than we think of!&nbsp; Give a countryman a plough of
silver, and he will plough with it all the season, and never know
its substance.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is thus with our daily
speech.&nbsp; What riches lie hidden in the vulgar tongue of the
poorest and most ignorant!&nbsp; What flowers of Paradise lie
under our feet, with their beauties and parts undistinguished and
undiscerned, from having been daily trodden on!&nbsp; O, sir,
look you!&mdash;but let me cover my eyes!&nbsp; Look at his
lips!&nbsp; Gracious Heaven! they were not thus when he
entered.&nbsp; They are blacker now than Harry Tewe&rsquo;s
bull-bitch&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Silas did lift up his eyes in astonishment and wrath;
and his worship, Sir Thomas, did open his wider and wider, and
cried by fits and starts:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gramercy! true enough! nay, afore God, too true by
half!&nbsp; I never saw the like!&nbsp; Who would believe
it?&nbsp; I wish I were fairly rid of this examination,&mdash;my
hands washed clean thereof!&nbsp; Another time,&mdash;anon!&nbsp;
We have our quarterly sessions; we are many together.&nbsp; At
present I remand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, indeed, unless Sir Silas had taken his worship by the
sleeve, he would may-hap have remanded the lad.&nbsp; But Sir
Silas, still holding the sleeve and shaking it, said,
hurriedly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me entreat your worship to ponder.&nbsp; What black
does the fellow talk of?&nbsp; My blood and bile rose up against
the rogue; but surely I did not turn black in the face, or in the
mouth, as the fellow calls it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether Master Silas had some suspicion and inkling of the
cause or not, he rubbed his right hand along his face and lips,
and, looking upon it, cried aloud,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho! is it off?&nbsp; There is some upon my
finger&rsquo;s end, I find.&nbsp; Now I have it,&mdash;ay, there
it is.&nbsp; That large splash upon the centre of the table is
tallow, by my salvation!&nbsp; The profligates sat up until the
candle burned out, and the last of it ran through the socket upon
the board.&nbsp; We knew it before.&nbsp; I did convey into my
mouth both fat and smut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of your cloth and kidney do that, good Master
Silas, and make no wry faces about it,&rdquo; quoth the
youngster, with indiscreet merriment, although short of laughter,
as became him who had already stepped too far and reached the
mire.</p>
<p>To save paper and time, I shall now, for the most part, write
only what they all said, not saying that they said it, and just
copying out in my clearest hand what fell respectively from their
mouths.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did indeed spit it forth, and emunge my lips, as who
should not?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it were so!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Would it were so</i>! in thy teeth,
hypocrite!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, truly, I likewise do incline to hope and credit
it, as thus paraphrased and expounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until this blessed day next year, sir, at the same
hour.&nbsp; You shall see it forth again at its due season; it
would be no miracle if it lasted.&nbsp; Spittle may cure sore
eyes, but not blasted mouths and scald consciences.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! who taught thee all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turned he leisurely toward Sir Silas, and placing his
hand outspreaden upon the arm of the chaplain, said unto him in a
low, judicial, hollow voice,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every word true and solemn!&nbsp; I have heard less
wise saws from between black covers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Silas was indignant at this under-rating, as he appeared
to think it, of the church and its ministry, and answered
impatiently, with Christian freedom,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your worship surely will not listen to this wild wizard
in his brothel-pulpit!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I live to hear Charlecote Hall called a
brothel-pulpit?&nbsp; Alas, then, I have lived too
long!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will try to amend that for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William seemed not to hear him, loudly as he spake and
pointedly unto the youngster, who wiped his eyes,
crying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commit me, sir! in mercy commit me!&nbsp; Master
Ephraim!&nbsp; Oh, Master Ephraim!&nbsp; A guiltless man may feel
all the pangs of the guilty!&nbsp; Is it you who are to make out
the commitment?&nbsp; Dispatch! dispatch.&nbsp; I am a-weary of
my life.&nbsp; If I dared to lie, I would plead
guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heyday!&nbsp; No wonder, Master Ephraim, thy entrails
are moved and wamble.&nbsp; Dost weep, lad?&nbsp; Nay, nay; thou
bearest up bravely.&nbsp; Silas, I now find, although the example
come before me from humble life, that what my mother said was
true&mdash;&rsquo;t was upon my father&rsquo;s
demise&mdash;&lsquo;In great grief there are few
tears.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon which did the youth, Willy Shakspeare, jog himself by the
memory, and repeat these short verses, not wide from the same
purport:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;There are, alas, some depths of woe<br
/>
Too vast for tears to overflow.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let those who are sadly vexed in spirit mind that
notion, whoever indited it, and be men.&nbsp; I always was; but
some little griefs have pinched me woundily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Silas grew impatient, for he had ridden hard that
morning, and had no cushion upon his seat, as Sir Thomas
had.&nbsp; I have seen in my time that he who is seated on
beech-wood hath very different thoughts and moralities from him
who is seated on goose-feathers under doe-skin.&nbsp; But that is
neither here nor there, albeit, an&rsquo; I die, as I must, my
heirs, Judith and her boy Elijah, may note it.</p>
<p>Master Silas, as above, looked sourishly, and cried
aloud,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The witnesses! the witnesses! testimony!
testimony!&nbsp; We shall now see whose black goes deepest.&nbsp;
There is a fork to be had that can hold the slipperiest eel, and
a finger that can strip the slimiest.&nbsp; I cry your worship to
the witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, indeed, we are losing the day; it wastes toward
noon, and nothing done.&nbsp; Call the witnesses.&nbsp; How are
they called by name?&nbsp; Give me the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The paper being forthwith delivered into his worship&rsquo;s
hand by the learned clerk, his worship did read aloud the name of
Euseby Treen.&nbsp; Whereupon did Euseby Treen come forth through
the great hall-door which was ajar, and answer most
audibly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your worship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straightway did Sir Thomas read aloud, in like form and
manner, the name of Joseph Carnaby; and in like manner as
aforesaid did Joseph Carnaby make answer and say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your worship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lastly did Sir Thomas turn the light of his countenance on
William Shakspeare, saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou seest these good men deponents against thee,
William Shakspeare.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then did Sir Thomas
pause.&nbsp; And pending this pause did William Shakspeare look
steadfastly in the faces of both; and stroking down his own with
the hollow of his hand from the jaw-bone to the chin-point, said
unto his honour,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith! it would give me much pleasure, and the
neighbourhood much vantage, to see these two fellows good
men.&nbsp; Joseph Carnaby and Euseby Treen!&nbsp; Why! your
worship! they know every hare&rsquo;s form in Luddington-field
better than their own beds, and as well pretty nigh as any
wench&rsquo;s in the parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turned he with jocular scoff unto Joseph Carnaby, thus
accosting him, whom his shirt, being made stiffer than usual for
the occasion, rubbed and frayed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Joseph! smoothen and soothe thy collar-piece again
and again!&nbsp; Hark ye!&nbsp; I know what smock that was
knavishly cut from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Silas rose up in high choler, and said unto Sir
Thomas,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir! do not listen to that lewd reviler; I wager ten
groats I prove him to be wrong in his scent.&nbsp; Joseph Carnaby
is righteous and discreet.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By daylight and before the parson.&nbsp; Bears and
boars are tame creatures, and discreet, in the sunshine and after
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Euseby
Treen</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know his down-goings and uprisings.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man and his wife are one, saith holy
Scripture.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Euseby
Treen</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sober-paced and rigid man, if such there be.&nbsp;
Few keep Lent like unto him.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warrant him, both lent and stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace and silence!&nbsp; Now, Joseph Carnaby, do thou
depose on particulars.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it please your worship!&nbsp; I was returning from
Hampton upon Allhallowmas eve, between the hours of ten and
eleven at night, in company with Master Euseby Treen; and when we
came to the bottom of Mickle Meadow, we heard several men in
discourse.&nbsp; I plucked Euseby Treen by the doublet, and
whispered in his ear, &lsquo;Euseby! Euseby! let us slink along
in the shadow of the elms and willows.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Euseby
Treen</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Willows and elm-trees</i> were the words.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, your worship! what discordances!&nbsp; They cannot
agree in their own story.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same thing, the same thing, in the main.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By less differences than this estates have been lost,
hearts broken, and England, our country, filled with homeless,
helpless, destitute orphans.&nbsp; I protest against
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Protest, indeed!&nbsp; He talks as if he were a member
of the House of Lords.&nbsp; They alone can protest.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your attorney may <i>object</i>, not <i>protest</i>,
before the lord judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proceed you, Joseph Carnaby.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the shadow of the willows and elm-trees,
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hints, no conspiracies!&nbsp; Keep to your own
story, man, and do not borrow his.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I overrule the objection.&nbsp; Nothing can be more
futile and frivolous.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So learned a magistrate as your worship will surely do
me justice by hearing me attentively.&nbsp; I am young;
nevertheless, having more than one year written in the office of
an attorney, and having heard and listened to many discourses and
questions on law, I cannot but remember the heavy fine inflicted
on a gentleman of this county who committed a poor man to prison
for being in possession of a hare, it being proved that the hare
was in his possession, and not he in the hare&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Synonymous term! synonymous term!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what term sayest thou was it?&nbsp; I do not
remember the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mere quibble mere equivocation!&nbsp; Jesuitical!&nbsp;
Jesuitical!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be Jesuitical, Sir Silas, if it dragged the
law by its perversions to the side of oppression and
cruelty.&nbsp; The order of Jesuits, I fear, is as numerous as
its tenets are lax and comprehensive.&nbsp; I am sorry to see
their frocks flounced with English serge.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand thee, viper!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cease thou, Will Shakspeare!&nbsp; Know thy
place.&nbsp; And do thou, Joseph Carnaby, take up again the
thread of thy testimony.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were still at some distance from the party, when on
a sudden Euseby hung an &mdash;&rdquo; <a
name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As well write <i>drew back</i>, Master Ephraim and
Master Silas!&nbsp; Be circumspecter in speech, Master Joseph
Carnaby!&nbsp; I did not look for such rude phrases from that
starch-warehouse under thy chin.&nbsp; Continue, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Euseby,&rsquo; said I in his ear, &lsquo;what
ails thee, Euseby?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I wag no farther,&rsquo;
quoth he.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a number of names and
voices!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreadful gang! a number of names and voices!&nbsp; Had
it been any other day in the year but Allhallowmas eve!&nbsp; To
steal a buck upon such a day!&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; God may pardon
even that.&nbsp; Go on, go on.&nbsp; But the laws of our country
must have their satisfaction and atonement.&nbsp; Were it upon
any other day in the calendar less holy, the buck were nothing,
or next to nothing, saving the law and our conscience and our
good report.&nbsp; Yet we, her Majesty&rsquo;s justices, must
stand in the gap, body and soul, against evil-doers.&nbsp; Now do
thou, in furtherance of this business, give thine aid unto us,
Joseph Carnaby!&mdash;remembering that mine eye from this
judgment-seat, and her Majesty&rsquo;s bright and glorious one
overlooking the whole realm, and the broader of God above, are
upon thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carnaby did quail a matter at these words about the
judgment-seat and the broad eye, aptly and gravely delivered by
him moreover who hath to administer truth and righteousness in
our ancient and venerable laws, and especially, at the present
juncture, in those against park-breaking and deer-stealing.&nbsp;
But finally, nought discomfited, and putting his hand valiantly
atwixt hip and midriff, so that his elbow well-nigh touched the
taller pen in the ink-pot, he went on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>In the shadow of the willows and
elm-trees</i>,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;<i>and get
nearer</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; We were still at some distance, maybe a
score of furlongs, from the party&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast said it already&mdash;all save the score of
furlongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast room for them, Master Silas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; quoth Master Silas, &ldquo;and would make
room for fifty, to let the fellow swing at his ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast room, Master Ephraim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T is done, most worshipful!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
The learned knight did not recollect that I could put fifty
furlongs in a needle&rsquo;s eye, give me pen fine enough.</p>
<p>But far be it from me to vaunt of my penmanship, although
there be those who do malign it, even in my own township and
parish; yet they never have unperched me from my calling, and
have had hard work to take an idle wench or two from under me on
Saturday nights.</p>
<p>I memorize thus much, not out of any malice or any soreness
about me, but that those of my kindred into whose hands it please
God these papers do fall hereafter, may bear up stoutly in such
straits; and if they be good at the cudgel, that they, looking
first at their man, do give it him heartily and unsparingly,
keeping within law.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, having overlooked what we had written, and
meditated a while thereupon, said unto Joseph,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appeareth by thy testimony that there was a huge and
desperate gang of them afoot.&nbsp; Revengeful dogs! it is
difficult to deal with them.&nbsp; The laws forbid precipitancy
and violence.&nbsp; A dozen or two may return and harm me; not
me, indeed, but my tenants and servants.&nbsp; I would fain act
with prudence, and like unto him who looketh abroad.&nbsp; He
must tie his shoe tightly who passeth through mire; he must step
softly who steppeth over stones; he must walk in the fear of the
Lord (which, without a brag, I do at this present feel upon me),
who hopeth to reach the end of the straightest road in
safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut! your worship!&nbsp; Her Majesty&rsquo;s
deputy hath matchlocks and halters at a knight&rsquo;s disposal,
or the world were topsyturvy indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mental ejaculations, and an influx of grace
thereupon, have shaken and washed from my brain all thy last
words, good Joseph!&nbsp; Thy companion here, Euseby Treen, said
unto thee&mdash;ay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said unto me, &lsquo;What a number of names and
voices!&nbsp; And there be but three living men in all!&nbsp; And
look again!&nbsp; Christ deliver us! all the shadows save one go
leftward; that one lieth right upon the river.&nbsp; It seemeth a
big, squat monster, shaking a little, as one ready to spring upon
its prey!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dead man in his last agonies, no doubt!&nbsp; Your
deer-stealer doth boggle at nothing.&nbsp; He hath alway the
knife in doublet and the devil at elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wot not of any keeper killed or missing.&nbsp; To
lose one&rsquo;s deer and keeper too were overmuch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do, in God&rsquo;s merciful name, hand unto me a glass
of sack, Master Silas!&nbsp; I wax faintish at the big, squat
man.&nbsp; He hath harmed not only me, but mine.&nbsp;
Furthermore, the examination is grown so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then was the wine delivered by Sir Silas into the hand of his
worship, who drank it off in a beaker of about half a
pint,&mdash;but little to his satisfaction, for he said shortly
afterward,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast thou poured no water into the sack, good Master
Silas?&nbsp; It seemeth weaker and washier than ordinary, and
affordeth small comfort unto the breast and stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I, truly, sir,&rdquo; replied Master Silas
&ldquo;and the bottle is a fresh and sound one.&nbsp; The cork
reported on drawing, as the best diver doth on sousing from
Warwick bridge into Avon.&nbsp; A rare cork! as bright as the
glass bottle, and as smooth as the lips of any cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mouth is out of taste this morning; or the same
wine, mayhap, hath a different force and flavor in the
dining-room and among friends.&nbsp; But to business&mdash;what
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Euseby Treen, what may it be?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;but dare not breathe
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I had taken a glass of wine, verily.&nbsp;
Attention to my duty as a magistrate is paramount.&nbsp; I mind
nothing else when that lies before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carnaby!&nbsp; I credit thy honesty, but doubt thy
manhood.&nbsp; Why not breathe it, with a vengeance?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Euseby who dared not.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand still!&nbsp; Say nothing yet; mind my
orders.&nbsp; Fair and softly! compose thyself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all stood silent for some time, and looked very composed,
awaiting the commands of the knight.&nbsp; His mind was clearly
in such a state of devotion that peradventure he might not have
descended for a while longer to his mundane duties, had not
Master Silas told him that, under the shadow of his wing, their
courage had returned and they were quite composed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may proceed,&rdquo; said the knight.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Treen did take off his cap and wipe his
forehead.&nbsp; I, for the sake of comforting him in this his
heaviness, placed my hand upon his crown; and truly I might have
taken it for a tuft of bents, the hair on end, the skin immovable
as God&rsquo;s earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, hearing these words, lifted up his hands above his
own head, and in the loudest voice he had yet uttered did he
cry,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful are thy ways in Israel, O Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, the pious knight did strike his knee with the palm
of his right hand; and then gave he a sign, bowing his head and
closing his eyes, by which Master Carnaby did think he signified
his pleasure that he should go on deposing.&nbsp; And he went on
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this moment one of the accomplices cried,
&lsquo;Willy!&nbsp; Willy! prithee stop! enough in all
conscience!&nbsp; First thou divertedst us from our undertaking
with thy strange vagaries, thy Italian girls&rsquo; nursery sigh,
thy Pucks and pinchings, and thy Windsor whimsies.&nbsp; No
kitten upon a bed of marum ever played such antics.&nbsp; It was
summer and winter, night and day with us within the hour; and in
such religion did we think and feel it, we would have broken the
man&rsquo;s jaw who gainsaid it.&nbsp; We have slept with thee
under the oaks in the ancient forest of Arden, and we have
wakened from our sleep in the tempest far at sea. <a
name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a"
class="citation">[29a]</a>&nbsp; Now art thou for frightening us
again out of all the senses thou hadst given us, with witches and
women more murderous than they.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then followed a deeper voice: &lsquo;Stouter men and
more resolute are few; but thou, my lad, hast words too weighty
for flesh and bones to bear up against.&nbsp; And who knows but
these creatures may pop amongst us at last, as the wolf did, sure
enough, upon him, the noisy rogue, who so long had been crying
<i>wolf</i>! and <i>wolf</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well spoken, for two thieves; albeit I miss the meaning
of the most part.&nbsp; Did they prevail with the scapegrace and
stop him?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last who had spoken did slap him on the shoulder,
saying, &lsquo;Jump into the punt, lad, and across.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon did Will Shakspeare jump into said punt, and begin to
sing a song about a mermaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William

<p>&ldquo;Sir! is this credible?&nbsp; I will be sworn I never
saw one; and verily do believe that scarcely one in a hundred
years doth venture so far up the Avon.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something in this.&nbsp; Thou mayest have sung
about one, nevertheless.&nbsp; Young poets take great liberties
with all female kind; not that mermaids are such very unlawful
game for them, and there be songs even about worse and staler
fish.&nbsp; Mind ye that!&nbsp; Thou hast written songs, and hast
sung them, and lewd enough they be, God wot!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, your worship! they were not mine then.&nbsp;
Peradventure the song about the mermaid may have been that
ancient one which every boy in most parishes has been singing for
many years, and, perhaps, his father before him; and somebody was
singing it then, mayhap, to keep up his courage in the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody would dare to sing in the presence of your
worship, unless commanded,&mdash;not even the mermaid
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canst thou sing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, I can sing nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canst thou repeat it from memory?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so long since I have thought about it, that I may
fail in the attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try, however.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;The mermaid sat upon the rocks<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; All day long,<br />
Admiring her beauty and combing her locks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And singing a mermaid song.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it? what was it?&nbsp; I thought as
much.&nbsp; There thou standest, like a woodpecker, chattering
and chattering, breaking the bark with thy beak, and leaving the
grub where it was.&nbsp; This is enough to put a saint out of
patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wishes of your worship possess a mysterious
influence,&mdash;I now remember all.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;And hear the mermaid&rsquo;s song
you may,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As sure as sure can be,<br />
If you will but follow the sun all day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And souse with him into the sea.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be an idle fellow who would take that trouble;
besides, unless he nicked the time he might miss the
monster.&nbsp; There be many who are slow to believe that the
mermaid singeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah sir! not only the mermaid singeth, but the merman
sweareth, as another old song will convince you.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would fain be convinced of God&rsquo;s wonders in the
great deeps, and would lean upon the weakest reed like unto thee
to manifest his glory.&nbsp; Thou mayest convince me.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William

<p style="text-align: center">1.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;A wonderful story, my lasses and
lads,<br />
Peradventure you&rsquo;ve heard from your grannams or dads,<br />
Of a merman that came every night to woo<br />
The spinster of spinsters, our Catherine Crewe.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">2.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;But
Catherine Crewe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is now seventy-two,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And avers she hath half forgotten<br />
The truth of the tale, when you ask her about it,<br />
And says, as if fain to deny it or flout it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Pooh</i>! <i>the merman is dead and
rotten</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">3.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;The merman came up as the mermen
are wont,<br />
To the top of the water, and then swam upon &rsquo;t;<br />
And Catherine saw him with both her two eyes,<br />
A lusty young merman full six feet in size.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">4.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;And
Catherine was frighten&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her scalp-skin it
tighten&rsquo;d,<br />
And her head it swam strangely, although on dry land;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the merman made bold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eftsoons to lay hold<br />
(<i>This</i> Catherine well recollects) of her hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">5.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;But how could a merman, if ever
so good,<br />
Or if ever so clever, be well understood<br />
By a simple young creature of our flesh and blood?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">6.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;Some
tell us the merman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can only speak German,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a voice between grunting and snoring;<br />
But Catherine says he had learned in the wars<br />
The language, persuasions, and oaths of our tars,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that even his voice was not foreign.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">7.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yet when she was asked how he
managed to hide<br />
The green fishy tail, coming out of the tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For night after night above twenty,<br />
&ldquo;You troublesome creatures!&rdquo; old Catherine
replied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>In his pocket</i>; won&rsquo;t that now
content ye?&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my doubts yet.&nbsp; I should have said unto
her, seriously, &lsquo;Kate!&nbsp; Kate!&nbsp; I am not
convinced.&rsquo;&nbsp; There may be witchcraft or sortilege in
it.&nbsp; I would have made it a star-chamber matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was one, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I am reminded by this silly, childish
song,&mdash;which, after all, is not the true
mermaid&rsquo;s,&mdash;thou didst tell me, Silas, that the papers
found in the lad&rsquo;s pocket were intended for
poetry.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he had missed his aim, sir, in your park, as he
hath missed it in his poetry.&nbsp; The papers are not worth
reading; they do not go against him in the point at
issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must see that,&mdash;they being taken upon his
person when apprehended.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Ephraim read them, then; it behooveth not me, a
Master of Arts, to con a whelp&rsquo;s whining.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do thou read them aloud unto us, good Master
Ephraim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon I took the papers which young Willy had not bestowed
much pains on; and they posed and puzzled me grievously, for they
were blotted and scrawled in many places, as if somebody had put
him out.&nbsp; These likewise I thought fit, after long
consideration, to write better, and preserve, great as the loss
of time is when men of business take in hand such unseemly
matters.&nbsp; However, they are decenter than most, and not
without their moral; for example:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;TO THE OWLET.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Who, O thou sapient, saintly bird!<br />
Thy shouted warnings ever heard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbleached by fear?<br />
The blue-faced blubbering imp, who steals<br />
Yon turnips, thinks thee at his heels,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afar or near.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The brawnier churl, who brags at
times<br />
To front and top the rankest crimes,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To paunch a deer,<br />
Quarter a priest, or squeeze a wench,&mdash;<br />
Scuds from thee, clammy as a tench,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knows not where.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;For this the righteous Lord of all<br />
Consigns to thee the castle-wall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When, many a year,<br />
Closed in the chancel-vaults, are eyes<br />
Rainy or sunny at the sighs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of knight or peer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, when I had ended, said unto me,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm herein; but are they over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied, &ldquo;Yea, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I miss the <i>posy</i>,&rdquo; quoth he; &ldquo;there
is usually a lump of sugar, or a smack thereof at the bottom of
the glass.&nbsp; They who are inexperienced in poetry do write it
as boys do their copies in the copy-book, without a flourish at
the finis.&nbsp; It is only the master who can do this
befittingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bowed unto his worship reverentially, thinking of a surety
he meant me, and returned my best thanks in set language.&nbsp;
But his worship rebuffed them, and told me graciously that he had
an eye on another of very different quality; that the plain sense
of his discourse might do for me, the subtler was certainly for
himself.&nbsp; He added that in his younger days he had heard
from a person of great parts, and had since profited by it, that
ordinary poets are like adders,&mdash;the tail blunt and the body
rough, and the whole reptile cold-blooded and sluggish:
&ldquo;whereas we,&rdquo; he subjoined, &ldquo;leap and caracole
and curvet, and are as warm as velvet, and as sleek as satin, and
as perfumed as a Naples fan, in every part of us; and the end of
our poems is as pointed as a perch&rsquo;s back-fin, and it
requires as much nicety to pick it up as a needle<a
name="citation38a"></a><a href="#footnote38a"
class="citation">[38a]</a> at nine groats the hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turning toward the culprit, he said mildly unto
him,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now why canst thou not apply thyself unto study?&nbsp;
Why canst thou not ask advice of thy superiors in rank and
wisdom?&nbsp; In a few years, under good discipline, thou
mightest rise from the owlet unto the peacock.&nbsp; I know not
what pleasant things might not come into the youthful head
thereupon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the bird of Venus, <a name="citation39b"></a><a
href="#footnote39b" class="citation">[39b]</a> goddess of
beauty.&nbsp; He flew down (I speak as a poet, and not in my
quality of knight and Christian) with half the stars of heaven
upon his tail; and his long, blue neck doth verily appear a
dainty slice out of the solid sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Silas smote me with his elbow, and said in my
ear,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wanteth not this stuffing; he beats a pheasant out
of the kitchen, to my mind, take him only at the pheasant&rsquo;s
size, and don&rsquo;t (upon your life) overdo him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never be cast down in spirit, nor take it too
&lsquo;grievously to heart, if the colour be a suspicion of the
pinkish,&mdash;no sign of rawness in that; none whatever.&nbsp;
It is as becoming to him as to the salmon; it is as natural to
your pea-chick in his best cookery, as it is to the finest
October morning,&mdash;moist underfoot, when partridge&rsquo;s
and puss&rsquo;s and renard&rsquo;s scent lies
sweetly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie Shakspeare, in the mean time, lifted up his hands above
his ears half a cubit, and taking breath again, said, audibly,
although he willed it to be said unto himself alone,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O that knights could deign to be our teachers!&nbsp;
Methinks I should briefly spring up into heaven, through the very
chink out of which the peacock took his neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Silas, who like myself and the worshipful knight, did
overhear him, said angrily,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To spring up into heaven, my lad, it would be as well
to have at least one foot upon the ground to make the spring
withal.&nbsp; I doubt whether we shall leave thee this
vantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay! thou art hard upon him, Silas,&rdquo; said
the knight.</p>
<p>I was turning over the other papers taken from the pocket of
the culprit on his apprehension, and had fixed my eyes on one,
when Sir Thomas caught them thus occupied, and
exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy upon us! have we more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your patience, worshipful sir!&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;must I forward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, yea,&rdquo; quoth he, resignedly, &ldquo;we must
go through; we are pilgrims in this life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then did I read, in a clear voice, the contents of paper the
second, being as followeth:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;THE MAID&rsquo;S LAMENT.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I loved him not; and yet, now he is
gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel I am alone.<br />
I check&rsquo;d him while he spoke; yet, could he speak,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas! I would not check.<br />
For reasons not to love him once I sought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wearied all my thought<br />
To vex myself and him: I now would give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My love could he but live<br />
Who lately lived for me, and when he found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;T was vain, in holy ground<br />
He hid his face amid the shades of death!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I waste for him my breath<br />
Who wasted his for me! but mine returns,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And this loin bosom burns<br />
With stifling heat, heaving it up in sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And waking me to weep<br />
Tears that had melted his soft heart.&nbsp; For years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wept he as bitter tears!<br />
<i>Merciful God</i>! such was his latest prayer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>These may she never share</i>!<br />
Quieter is his breath, his breast more cold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than daisies in the mould,<br />
Where children spell, athwart the churchyard gate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His name and life&rsquo;s brief date.<br />
Pray for him, gentle souls, whoe&rsquo;er you be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, oh! pray too for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas had fallen into a most comfortable and refreshing
slumber ere this lecture was concluded; but the pause broke it,
as there be many who experience after the evening service in our
parish-church.&nbsp; Howbeit, he had presently all his wits about
him, and remembered well that he had been carefully counting the
syllables, about the time when I had pierced as far as into the
middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said he to Willy, &ldquo;thou givest
short measure in every other sack of the load.&nbsp; Thy
uppermost stake is of right length; the undermost falleth off,
methinks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Ephraim, canst thou count syllables?&nbsp; I
mean no offence.&nbsp; I may have counted wrongfully myself, not
being born nor educated for an accountant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At such order I did count; and truly the suspicion was as just
as if he had neither been a knight nor a sleeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sad stuff! sad stuff, indeed!&rdquo; said Master Silas,
&ldquo;and smelling of popery and wax-candles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay?&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, &ldquo;I must sift
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If praying for the dead is not popery,&rdquo; said
Master Silas, &ldquo;I know not what the devil is.&nbsp; Let them
pray for us; they may know whether it will do us any good.&nbsp;
We need not pray for them; we cannot tell whether it will do them
any.&nbsp; I call this sound divinity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are our churchmen all agreed thereupon?&rdquo; asked
Sir Thomas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wisest are,&rdquo; replied Master Silas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some lank rascals who will never agree upon
anything but upon doubting.&nbsp; I would not give ninepence for
the best gown upon the most thrifty of &rsquo;em; and their
fingers are as stiff and hard with their pedlary, knavish
writing, as any bishop&rsquo;s are with chalk-stones won honestly
from the gout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas took the paper up from the table on which I had
laid it, and said after a while,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man may only have swooned.&nbsp; I scorn to play
the critic, or to ask any one the meaning of a word; but,
sirrah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he turned in his chair from the side of Master Silas, and
said unto Willy,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William Shakspeare! out of this thraldom in regard to
popery, I hope, by God&rsquo;s blessing, to deliver thee.&nbsp;
If ever thou repeatest the said verses, knowing the man to be to
all intents and purposes a dead man, prythee read the censurable
line as thus corrected,&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">&lsquo;Pray for our
Virgin Queen, gentles! whoe&rsquo;er you be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>although it is not quite the thing that another should impinge
so closely on her skirts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this improvement, of me suggested, thou mayest make
some amends&mdash;a syllable or two&mdash;for the many that are
weighed in the balance and are found wanting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turning unto me, as being conversant by my profession in
such matters, and the same being not very worthy of learned and
staid clerks the like of Master Silas, he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the youths that did ever write in verse, this
one verily is he who hath the fewest flowers and devices.&nbsp;
But it would be loss of time to form a border, in the fashion of
a kingly crown, or a dragon, or a Turk on horseback, out of
buttercups and dandelions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Ephraim! look at these badgers! with a long leg
on one quarter and a short leg on the other.&nbsp; The wench
herself might well and truly have said all that matter without
the poet, bating the rhymes and metre.&nbsp; Among the girls in
the country there are many such <i>shilly-shallys</i>, who give
themselves sore eyes and sharp eye-water; I would cure them rod
in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon did William Shakspeare say, with great
humility,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I, may it please your worship, an they would
let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incorrigible sluts!&nbsp; Out upon &rsquo;em! and thou
art no better than they are,&rdquo; quoth the knight.</p>
<p>Master Silas cried aloud, &ldquo;No better, marry! they at the
worst are but carted and whipped for the edification of the
market-folks. <a name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a>&nbsp; Not a squire or parson in the
country round but comes in his best to see a man
hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The edification then is higher by a deal,&rdquo; said
William, very composedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troth! is it,&rdquo; replied Master Silas.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The most poisonous reptile has the richest jewel in his
head; thou shalt share the richest gift bestowed upon royalty,
and shalt cure the king&rsquo;s evil.&rdquo; <a
name="citation45a"></a><a href="#footnote45a"
class="citation">[45a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is more tractable, then, than the
church&rsquo;s,&rdquo; quoth William; and, turning his face
toward the chair, he made an obeisance to Sir Thomas,
saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir! the more submissive my behaviour is, the more
vehement and boisterous is Master Silas.&nbsp; My gentlest words
serve only to carry him toward the contrary quarter, as the south
wind bloweth a ship northward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Youth,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, smiling most benignly,
&ldquo;I find, and well indeed might I have surmised, thy utter
ignorance of winds, equinoxes, and tides.&nbsp; Consider now a
little!&nbsp; With what propriety can a wind be called a south
wind if it bloweth a vessel to the north?&nbsp; Would it be a
south wind that blew it from this hall into Warwick
market-place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a strong one,&rdquo; said Master Silas unto
me, pointing his remark, as witty men are wont, with the
elbow-pan.</p>
<p>But Sir Thomas, who waited for an answer, and received none,
continued,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would a man be called a good man who tended and pushed
on toward evil?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stand corrected.&nbsp; I could sail to Cathay or
Tartary <a name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a> with half the nautical knowledge I
have acquired in this glorious hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil impelling a mortal to wrong courses, is
thereby known to be the devil.&nbsp; He, on the contrary, who
exciteth to good is no devil, but an angel of light, or under the
guidance of one.&nbsp; The devil driveth unto his own home; so
doth the south wind, so doth the north wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! alas! we possess not the mastery over our own
weak minds when a higher spirit standeth nigh and draweth us
within his influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those thy words are well enough,&mdash;very well, very
good, wise, discreet, judicious beyond thy years.&nbsp; But then
that <i>sailing</i> comes in an awkward, ugly way across
me,&mdash;that <i>Cathay</i>, that <i>Tartarus</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a care!&nbsp; Do thou nothing rashly.&nbsp; Mind!
an thou stealest my punt for the purpose, I send the constable
after thee or e&rsquo;er thou art half way over.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would make a stock-fish of me an he caught me.&nbsp;
It is hard sailing out of his straits, although they be carefully
laid down in most parishes, and may have taken them from actual
survey.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, we have bestowed on him already well-nigh a good
hour of our time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, who was always fond of giving admonition and
reproof to the ignorant and erring, and who had found the seeds
(little mustard-seeds, &rsquo;t is true, and never likely to
arise into the great mustard-tree of the Gospel) in the poor lad
Willy, did let his heart soften a whit tenderer and kindlier than
Master Silas did, and said unto Master Silas,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good hour of our time!&nbsp; Yea, Silas! and thou
wouldst give <i>him</i> eternity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, sir! would you let him go?&rdquo; said Master
Silas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Presently we shall have neither deer nor dog,
neither hare nor coney, neither swan nor heron; every carp from
pool, every bream from brook, will be groped for.&nbsp; The
marble monuments in the church will no longer protect the leaden
coffins; and if there be any ring of gold on the finger of knight
or dame, it will be torn away with as little ruth and ceremony as
the ring from a butchered sow&rsquo;s snout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awful words!&nbsp; Master Silas,&rdquo; quoth the
knight, musing; &ldquo;but thou mistakest my intentions.&nbsp; I
let him not go; howbeit, at worst I would only mark him in the
ear, and turn him up again after this warning, peradventure with
a few stripes to boot athwart the shoulders, in order to make
them shrug a little, and shake off the burden of
idleness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I, having seen, I dare not say the innocence, but the
innocent and simple manner of Willy, and pitying his tender
years, and having an inkling that he was a lad, poor Willy! whom
God had endowed with some parts, and into whose breast he had
instilled that milk of loving-kindness by which alone we can be
like unto those little children of whom is the household and
kingdom of our Lord,&mdash;I was moved, yea, even unto
tears.&nbsp; And now, to bring gentler thoughts into the hearts
of Master Silas and Sir Thomas, who, in his wisdom, deemed it a
light punishment to slit an ear or two, or inflict a wiry
scourging, I did remind his worship that another paper was yet
unread, at least to them, although I had been perusing it.</p>
<p>This was much pleasanter than the two former, and overflowing
with the praises of the worthy knight and his gracious lady; and
having an echo to it in another voice, I did hope thereby to
disarm their just wrath and indignation.&nbsp; It was thus
couched:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;FIRST SHEPHERD.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Jesu! what lofty elms are here!<br />

<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;SECOND SHEPHERD.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;With conscience proof &rsquo;gainst
Satan&rsquo;s shock,<br />
Albeit finer than her smock, <a name="citation50a"></a><a

Marry! her smiles are not of vanity,<br />
But resting on sound Christianity.<br />
Faith, you would swear, had nail&rsquo;d <a
name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b"
class="citation">[50b]</a> her ears on<br />
The book and cushion of the parson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks the rhyme at the latter end might be
bettered,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas.&nbsp; &ldquo;The remainder is
indited not unaptly.&nbsp; But, young man, never having obtained
the permission of my honourable dame to praise her in guise of
poetry, I cannot see all the merit I would fain discern in the
verses.&nbsp; She ought first to have been sounded; and it being
certified that she disapproved not her glorification, then might
it be trumpeted forth into the world below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most worshipful knight,&rdquo; replied the youngster,
&ldquo;I never could take it in hand to sound a dame of
quality,&mdash;they are all of them too deep and too practised
for me, and have better and abler men about &rsquo;em.&nbsp; And
surely I did imagine to myself that if it were asked of any
honourable man (omitting to speak of ladies) whether he would
give permission to be openly praised, he would reject the
application as a gross offence.&nbsp; It appeareth to me that
even to praise one&rsquo;s self, although it be shameful, is less
shameful than to throw a burning coal into the incense-box that
another doth hold to waft before us, and then to snift and simper
over it, with maidenly, wishful coyness, as if forsooth one had
no hand in setting it asmoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then did Sir Thomas, in his zeal to instruct the ignorant, and
so make the lowly hold up their heads, say unto him,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but all the great do thus.&nbsp; Thou must not
praise them without leave and license.&nbsp; Praise unpermitted
is plebeian praise.&nbsp; It is presumption to suppose that thou
knowest enough of the noble and the great to discover their high
qualities.&nbsp; They alone could manifest them unto thee.&nbsp;
It requireth much discernment and much time to enucleate and
bring into light their abstruse wisdom and gravely featured
virtues.&nbsp; Those of ordinary men lie before thee in thy daily
walks; thou mayest know them by converse at their tables, as thou
knowest the little tame squirrel that chippeth his nuts in the
open sunshine of a bowling-green.&nbsp; But beware how thou
enterest the awful arbours of the great, who conceal their
magnanimity in the depths of their hearts, as lions
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then paused; and observing the youth in deep and earnest
meditation over the fruits of his experience, as one who tasted
and who would fain digest them; he gave him encouragement, and
relieved the weight of his musings by kind interrogation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, then, these verses are thine own?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
youth answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I must confess my fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who was the shepherd written here <i>Second
Shepherd</i>, that had the ill manners to interrupt thee?&nbsp;
Methinks, in helping thee to mount the saddle, he pretty nigh
tossed thee over, <a name="citation53a"></a><a
href="#footnote53a" class="citation">[53a]</a> with his jerks and
quirks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for any answer, his worship continued his
interrogations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you woolstaplers call yourselves by the style
and title of shepherds?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, sir, do we; and I trust by right.&nbsp; The
last owner of any place is called the master more properly than
the dead and gone who once held it.&nbsp; If that be true (and
who doubts it?) we, who have the last of the sheep, namely, the
wool and skin, and who buy all of all the flock, surely may more
properly be called shepherds than those idle vagrants who tend
them only for a season, selling a score or purchasing a score, as
may happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Sir Thomas did pause a while, and then said unto Master
Silas,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own cogitations, and not this stripling, have
induced me to consider and to conclude a weighty matter for
knightly scholarship.&nbsp; I never could rightly understand
before how Colin Clout, and sundry others calling themselves
shepherds, should argue like doctors in law, physic, and
divinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas! they were woolstaplers; and they must have
exercised their wits in dealing with tithe-proctors and parsons,
and moreover with fellows of colleges from our two learned
universities, who have sundry lands held under them, as thou
knowest, and take the small tithes in kind.&nbsp; Colin Clout,
methinks, from his extensive learning, might have acquired enough
interest with the Queen&rsquo;s Highness to change his name for
the better, and, furthermore, her royal license to carry armorial
bearings, in no peril of taint from so unsavoury an
appellation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Silas did interrupt this discourse, by
saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it please your worship, the constable is
waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereat Sir Thomas said, tartly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let him wait.&rdquo; <a name="citation55a"></a><a
href="#footnote55a" class="citation">[55a]</a></p>
<p>Then to me,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we have done with verses, and are not to be
befooled by the lad&rsquo;s nonsense touching mermaids or worse
creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then to Will,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William Shakspeare! we live in a Christian land, a land
of great toleration and forbearance.&nbsp; Three score cartsful
of fagots a year are fully sufficient to clear our English air
from every pestilence of heresy and witchcraft.&nbsp; It hath not
alway been so, God wot!&nbsp; Innocent and guilty took their
turns before the fire, like geese and capons.&nbsp; The spit was
never cold; the cook&rsquo;s sleeve was ever above the
elbow.&nbsp; Countrymen came down from distant villages into
towns and cities, to see perverters whom they had never heard of,
and to learn the righteousness of hatred.&nbsp; When heretics
waxed fewer the religious began to grumble that God, in losing
his enemies, had also lost his avengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not thou, William Shakspeare, dig the hole for thy
own stake.&nbsp; If thou canst not make men wise, do not make
them merry at thy cost.&nbsp; We are not to be paganised any
more.&nbsp; Having struck from our calendars, and unnailed from
our chapels, many dozens of decent saints, with as little
compunction and remorse as unlucky lads throw frog-spawn and
tadpoles out of stagnant ditches, never let us think of bringing
back among us the daintier divinities they ousted.&nbsp; All
these are the devil&rsquo;s imps, beautiful as they appear in
what we falsely call works of genius, which really and truly are
the devil&rsquo;s own,&mdash;statues more graceful than humanity,
pictures more living than life, eloquence that raised single
cities above empires, poor men above kings.&nbsp; If these are
not Satan&rsquo;s works, where are they?&nbsp; I will tell thee
where they are likewise.&nbsp; In holding vain converse with
false gods.&nbsp; The utmost we can allow in propriety is to call
a knight Ph&oelig;bus, and a dame Diana.&nbsp; They are not meat
for every trencher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must now proceed straightforward with the business
on which thou comest before us.&nbsp; What further sayest thou,
witness?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Euseby
Treen</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His face was toward me; I saw it clearly.&nbsp; The
graver man followed him into the punt, and said, roughly,
&lsquo;We shall get hanged as sure as thou pipest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereunto he answered,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Naturally, as fall upon the ground<br />
The leaves in winter and the girls in spring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then began he again with the mermaid; whereat the graver
man clapped a hand before his mouth, and swore he should take her
in wedlock, to have and to hold, if he sang another stave.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And thou shalt be her pretty little bridemaid,&rsquo;
quoth he gaily to the graver man, chucking him under the
chin.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did Carnaby say unto thee, or what didst thou
say unto Carnaby?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Euseby
Treen</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carnaby said unto me, somewhat tauntingly, &lsquo;The
big squat man, that lay upon thy bread-basket like a nightmare,
is a punt at last, it seems.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Punt, and more too,&rsquo; answered I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Tarry awhile, and thou shalt see this punt (so let me call
it) lead them into temptation, and swamp them or carry them to
the gallows; I would not stay else.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what didst thou, Joseph Carnaby?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding him neither slack nor shy, I readily
tarried.&nbsp; We knelt down opposite each other, and said our
prayers; and he told me he was now comfortable.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
evil one,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;hath enough to mind yonder: he
shall not hurt us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never was a sweeter night, had there been but some mild
ale under it, which any one would have sworn it was made
for.&nbsp; The milky way looked like a long drift of hail-stones
on a sunny ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast thou done describing?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, an please your worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s blessing be upon thee, honest
Carnaby!&nbsp; I feared a moon-fall.&nbsp; In our days nobody can
think about a plum-pudding but the moon comes down upon it.&nbsp;
I warrant ye this lad here hath as many moons in his poems as the
Saracens had in their banners.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not hatched mine yet, sir.&nbsp; Whenever I do I
trust it will be worth taking to market.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said all I know of the stars; but Master Euseby can
run over half a score and upward, here and there.&nbsp; &lsquo;Am
I right, or wrong?&rsquo; cried he, spreading on the back of my
hand all his fingers, stiff as antlers and cold as icicles.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Look up, Joseph! Joseph! there is no Lucifer in the
firmament!&rsquo;&nbsp; I myself did feel queerish and qualmy
upon hearing that a star was missing, being no master of
gainsaying it; and I abased my eyes, and entreated of Euseby to
do in like manner.&nbsp; And in this posture did we both of us
remain; and the missing star did not disquiet me; and all the
others seemed as if they knew us and would not tell of us; and
there was peace and pleasantness over sky and earth.&nbsp; And I
said to my companion,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How quiet now, good Master Euseby, are all
God&rsquo;s creatures in this meadow, because they never pry into
such high matters, but breathe sweetly among the pig-nuts.&nbsp;
The only things we hear or see stirring are the glow-worms and
dormice, as though they were sent for our edification, teaching
us to rest contented with our own little light, and to come out
and seek our sustenance where none molest or thwart
us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye would have it thus, no doubt, when your pockets and
pouches are full of gins and nooses.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bridle upon thy dragon&rsquo;s tongue!&nbsp; And do
thou, Master Joseph, quit the dormice and glow-worms, and tell us
whither did the rogues go.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wot not after they had crossed the river they were
soon out of sight and hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went they toward Charlecote?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their first steps were thitherward.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they come back unto the punt?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went down the stream in it, and crossed the Avon
some fourscore yards below where we were standing.&nbsp; They
came back in it, and moored it to the sedges in which it had
stood before.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long were they absent?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within an hour, or thereabout, all the three men
returned.&nbsp; Will Shakspeare and another were sitting in the
middle, the third punted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Remember now, gentles!&rsquo; quoth William
Shakspeare, &lsquo;the road we have taken is henceforward a
footpath for ever, according to law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How so?&rsquo; asked the punter, turning toward
him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Forasmuch as a corpse hath passed along
it,&rsquo; answered he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereupon both Euseby and myself did forthwith fall
upon our faces, commending our souls unto the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was then really the dead body that quivered so
fearfully upon the water, covering all the punt!&nbsp; Christ,
deliver us!&nbsp; I hope the keeper they murdered was not
Jeremiah.&nbsp; His wife and four children would be very
chargeable, and the man was by no means amiss.&nbsp; Proceed!
what further?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On reaching the bank, &lsquo;I never sat pleasanter in
my lifetime,&rsquo; said William Shakspeare, &lsquo;than upon
this carcass.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord have mercy upon us!&nbsp; Thou upon a carcass, at
thy years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the knight drew back his chair half an ell farther from
the table, and his lips quivered at the thought of such
inhumanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what said he more? and what did he?&rdquo; asked
the knight.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He patted it smartly, and said, &lsquo;Lug it out;
break it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These four poor children! who shall feed
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir! in God&rsquo;s name have you forgotten that
Jeremiah is gone to Nuneaton to see his father, and that the
murdered man is the buck?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They killed the buck likewise.&nbsp; But what, ye
cowardly varlets! have ye been deceiving me all this time?&nbsp;
And thou, youngster! couldst thou say nothing to clear up the
case?&nbsp; Thou shalt smart for it.&nbsp; Methought I had lost
by a violent death the best servant ever man had&mdash;righteous,
if there be no blame in saying it, as the prophet whose name he
beareth, and brave as the lion of Judah.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, if these men could deceive your worship for a
moment, they might deceive me for ever.&nbsp; I could not guess
what their story aimed at, except my ruin.&nbsp; I am inclined to
lean for once toward the opinion of Master Silas, and to believe
it was really the stolen buck on which this William (if indeed
there is any truth at all in the story) was sitting.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What more hast thou for me that is not enigma or
parable?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not see the carcass, man&rsquo;s or
beast&rsquo;s, may it please your worship, and I have recited and
can recite that only which I saw and heard.&nbsp; After the words
of lugging out and breaking it, knives were drawn
accordingly.&nbsp; It was no time to loiter or linger.&nbsp; We
crope back under the shadow of the alders and hazels on the high
bank that bordereth Mickle Meadow, and, making straight for the
public road, hastened homeward.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearing this deposition, dost thou affirm the like upon
thy oath, Master Euseby Treen, or dost thou vary in aught
essential?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Euseby
Treen</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my oath I do depose and affirm the like, and truly
the identical same; and I will never more vary upon aught
essential.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do now further demand of thee whether thou knowest
anything more appertaining unto this business.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Euseby
Treen</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, verily; that your worship may never hold me for
timorsome and superstitious, I do furthermore add that some other
than deer-stealers was abroad.&nbsp; In sign whereof, although it
was the dryest and clearest night of the season, my jerkin was
damp inside and outside when I reached my house-door.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warrant thee, Euseby, the damp began not at the
outside.&nbsp; A word in thy ear&mdash;Lucifer was thy tapster, I
trow.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irreverent swine! hast no awe nor shame.&nbsp; Thou
hast aggravated thy offence, William Shakspeare, by thy
foul-mouthedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must remind your worship that he not only has
committed this iniquity afore, but hath pawed the puddle he made,
and relapsed into it after due caution and reproof.&nbsp; God
forbid that what he spake against me, out of the gall of his
proud stomach, should move me.&nbsp; I defy him, a low, ignorant
wretch, a rogue and vagabond, a thief and cut-throat, a &mdash;
<a name="citation66a"></a><a href="#footnote66a"
class="citation">[66a]</a> monger and mutton-eater.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your worship doth hear the learned clerk&rsquo;s
testimony in my behalf.&nbsp; &lsquo;Out of the mouth of babes
and sucklings&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas, the youth has failings&mdash;a madcap; but he is
pious.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, no, sir!&nbsp; Would I were!&nbsp; But Sir Silas,
like the prophet, came to curse, and was forced to bless me, even
me, a sinner, a mutton-eater!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou urgedst him.&nbsp; He beareth no ill-will toward
thee.&nbsp; Thou knewedst, I suspect, that the blackness in his
mouth proceeded from a natural cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord is merciful!&nbsp; I was brought hither in
jeopardy; I shall return in joy.&nbsp; Whether my innocence be
declared or otherwise, my piety and knowledge will be forwarded
and increased; for your worship will condescend, even from the
judgment-seat, to enlighten the ignorant where a soul shall be
saved or lost.&nbsp; And I, even I, may trespass a moment on your
courtesy.&nbsp; I quail at the words <i>natural cause</i>.&nbsp;
Be there any such?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Youth!&nbsp; I never thought thee so staid.&nbsp; Thou
hast, for these many months, been represented unto me as one
dissolute and light, much given unto mummeries and mysteries,
wakes and carousals, cudgel-fighters and mountebanks and wanton
women.&nbsp; They do also represent of thee&mdash;I hope it may
be without foundation&mdash;that thou enactest the parts, not
simply of foresters and fairies, girls in the green-sickness and
friars, lawyers and outlaws, but likewise, having small reverence
for station, of kings and queens, knights and privy-counsellors,
in all their glory.&nbsp; It hath been whispered, moreover, and
the testimony of these two witnesses doth appear in some measure
to countenance and confirm it, that thou hast at divers times
this last summer been seen and heard alone, inasmuch as human eye
may discover, on the narrow slip of greensward between the Avon
and the chancel, distorting thy body like one possessed, and
uttering strange language, like unto incantation.&nbsp; This,
however, cometh not before me.&nbsp; Take heed! take heed unto
thy ways; there are graver things in law even than homicide and
deer-stealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And strong against him.&nbsp; Folks have been consumed
at the stake for pettier felonies and upon weaker
evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To that anon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Shakspeare did hold down his head, answering
nought.&nbsp; And Sir Thomas spake again unto him, as one mild
and fatherly, if so be that such a word may be spoken of a knight
and parliament-man.&nbsp; And these are the words he
spake:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reason and ruminate with thyself now.&nbsp; To pass
over and pretermit the danger of representing the actions of the
others, and mainly of lawyers and churchmen, the former of whom
do pardon no offences, and the latter those only against God,
having no warrant for more, canst thou believe it innocent to
counterfeit kings and queens?&nbsp; Supposest thou that if the
impression of their faces on a farthing be felonious and
rope-worthy, the imitation of head and body, voice and bearing,
plume and strut, crown and mantle, and everything else that
maketh them royal and glorious, be aught less?&nbsp; Perpend,
young man, perpend!&nbsp; Consider, who among inferior mortals
shall imitate them becomingly?&nbsp; Dreamest thou they talk and
act like checkmen at Banbury fair?&nbsp; How can thy shallow
brain suffice for their vast conceptions?&nbsp; How darest thou
say, as they do: &lsquo;Hang this fellow; quarter that; flay;
mutilate; stab; shoot; press; hook; torture; burn
alive&rsquo;?&nbsp; These are royalties.&nbsp; Who appointed thee
to such office?&nbsp; The Holy Ghost?&nbsp; He alone can confer
it; but when wert thou anointed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>William was so zealous in storing up these verities that he
looked as though he were unconscious that the pouring-out was
over.&nbsp; He started, which he had not done before, at the
voice of Master Silas; but soon recovered his complacency, and
smiled with much serenity at being called low-minded varlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Low-minded varlet!&rdquo; cried Master Silas, most
contemptuously, &ldquo;dost thou imagine that king calleth king,
like thy chums, <i>filcher</i> and <i>fibber</i>,
<i>whirligig</i> and <i>nincompoop</i>?&nbsp; Instead of this low
vulgarity and sordid idleness, ending in nothing, they throw at
one another such fellows as thee by the thousand, and when they
have cleared the land, render God thanks and make
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willy did now sigh out his ignorance of these matters; and he
sighed, mayhap, too, at the recollection of the peril he had run
into, and had ne&rsquo;er a word on the nail. <a
name="citation70a"></a><a href="#footnote70a"
class="citation">[70a]</a></p>
<p>The bowels of Sir Thomas waxed tenderer and tenderer; and he
opened his lips in this fashion:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stripling!&nbsp; I would now communicate unto thee, on
finding thee docile and assentaneous, the instruction thou
needest on the signification of the words <i>natural cause</i>,
if thy duty toward thy neighbour had been first instilled into
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Master Silas did interpose, for the dinner hour was
drawing nigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot do all at once,&rdquo; quoth he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Coming out of order, it might harm him.&nbsp; Malt before
hops, the world over, or the beer muddies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sir Thomas was not to be pricked out of his form even by
so shrewd a pricker; and like unto one who heareth not, he
continued to look most graciously on the homely vessel that stood
ready to receive his wisdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy mind,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;being unprepared for
higher cogitations, and the groundwork and religious duty not
being well rammer-beaten and flinted, I do pass over this
supererogatory point, and inform thee rather, that bucks and
swans and herons have something in their very names announcing
them of knightly appurtenance; and (God forfend that evil do
ensue therefrom!) that a goose on the common, or a game-cock on
the loft of a cottager or villager, may be seized, bagged, and
abducted, with far less offence to the laws.&nbsp; In a buck
there is something so gainly and so grand, he treadeth the earth
with such ease and such agility, he abstaineth from all other
animals with such punctilious avoidance, one would imagine God
created him when he created knighthood.&nbsp; In the swan there
is such purity, such coldness is there in the element he
inhabiteth, such solitude of station, that verily he doth remind
me of the Virgin Queen herself.&nbsp; Of the heron I have less to
say, not having him about me; but I never heard his lordly croak
without the conceit that it resembled a chancellor&rsquo;s or a
primate&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do perceive, William Shakspeare, thy compunction and
contrition.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking, may it please your worship, of the
game-cock and the goose, having but small notion of herons.&nbsp;
This doctrine of abduction, please your worship, hath been alway
inculcated by the soundest of our judges.&nbsp; Would they had
spoken on other points with the same clearness.&nbsp; How many
unfortunates might thereby have been saved from crossing the
Cordilleras!&rdquo; <a name="citation72a"></a><a
href="#footnote72a" class="citation">[72a]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay! they have been fain to fly the country at last,
thither or elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then did Sir Thomas call unto him Master Silas, and
say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk we into the bay-window.&nbsp; And thou mayest
come, Ephraim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when we were there together, I, Master Silas, and his
worship, did his worship say unto the chaplain, but oftener
looking toward me,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not ashamed to avouch that it goeth against me to
hang this young fellow, richly as the offence in its own nature
doth deserve it, he talketh so reasonably; not indeed so
reasonably, but so like unto what a reasonable man may listen to
and reflect on.&nbsp; There is so much, too, of compassion for
others in hard cases, and something so very near in semblance to
innocence itself in that airy swing of lightheartedness about
him.&nbsp; I cannot fix my eyes (as one would say) on the
shifting and sudden <i>shade-and-shine</i>, which cometh back to
me, do what I will, and mazes me in a manner, and blinks
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture I was ready to fall upon the ground before
his worship, and clasp his knees for Willy&rsquo;s pardon.&nbsp;
But he had so many points about him, that I feared to discompose
&rsquo;em, and thus make bad worse.&nbsp; Besides which, Master
Silas left me but scanty space for good resolutions,
crying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be committed, to save time.&nbsp; Afterward he
may be sentenced to death, or he may not.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T were shame upon me were he not; &rsquo;t were
indication that I acted unadvisedly in the commitment.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The penalty of the law may be commuted, if expedient,
on application to the fountain of mercy in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, Silas, those shall be standing round the fount
of mercy who play in idleness and wantonness with its waters, and
let them not flow widely, nor take their natural course.&nbsp;
Dutiful gallants may encompass it, and it may linger among the
flowers they throw into it, and never reach the parched lip on
the wayside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are homely thoughts&mdash;thoughts from a-field,
thoughts for the study and housekeeper&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; But
whenever I have given utterance unto them, as my heart hath often
prompted me with beatings at the breast, my hearers seemed to
bear toward me more true and kindly affection than my richest
fancies and choicest phraseologies could purchase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T were convenient to bethink thee, should any
other great man&rsquo;s park have been robbed this season, no
judge upon the bench will back my recommendation for mercy.&nbsp;
And, indeed, how could I expect it?&nbsp; Things may soon be
brought to such a pass that their lordships shall scarcely find
three haunches each upon the circuit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sir!&rdquo; quoth Master Silas, &ldquo;you have a
right to go on in your own way.&nbsp; Make him only give up the
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Sir Thomas reddened with righteous indignation, and
answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot think it! such a stripling! poor, penniless;
it must be some one else.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now Master Silas did
redden in his turn, redder than Sir Thomas, and first asked
me,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil do you stare at?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then
asked his worship,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who should it be if not the rogue?&rdquo; and his lips
turned as blue as a blue-bell.&nbsp; Then Sir Thomas left the
window, and again took his chair, and having stood so long on his
legs, groaned upon it to ease him.&nbsp; His worship scowled with
all his might, and looked exceedingly wroth and vengeful at the
culprit, and said unto him,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harkye, knave!&nbsp; I have been conferring with my
learned clerk and chaplain in what manner I may, with the least
severity, rid the county (which thou disgracest) of
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Shakspeare raised up his eyes, modestly and fearfully,
and said slowly these few words, which, had they been a better
and nobler man&rsquo;s, would deserve to be written in letters of
gold.&nbsp; I, not having that art nor substance, do therefore
write them in my largest and roundest character, and do leave
space about &rsquo;em, according to their rank and
dignity:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worshipful sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <span class="smcap">word in the ear is often as good
as a halter under it, and saves the groat</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou discoursest well,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas,
&ldquo;but others can discourse well likewise.&nbsp; Thou shalt
avoid; I am resolute.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I supplicate your honour to impart unto me, in your
wisdom, the mode and means whereby I may surcease to be
disgraceful to the county.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not bloody-minded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, thou shalt have the fairest and fullest
examination.&nbsp; Much hath been deposed against thee; something
may come forth for thy advantage.&nbsp; I will not thy death;
thou shalt not die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The laws have loopholes, like castles, both to shoot
from and to let folks down.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That pointed ear would look the better for paring, and
that high forehead can hold many letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon did William, poor lad! turn deadly pale, but spake
not.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas then abated a whit of his severity, and said,
staidly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Testimony doth appear plain and positive against thee;
nevertheless am I minded and prompted to aid thee myself, in
disclosing and unfolding what thou couldst not of thine own wits,
in furtherance of thine own defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One witness is persuaded and assured of the evil spirit
having been abroad, and the punt appeared unto him diversely from
what it appeared unto the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the evil spirit produced one appearance, he might
have produced all, with deference to the graver judgment of your
worship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If what seemed <i>punt</i> was <i>devil</i>, what
seemed <i>buck</i> might have been <i>devil</i> too; nay, more
easily, the horns being forthcoming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thieves and reprobates do resemble him more nearly
still; and it would be hard if he could not make free with their
bodies, when he has their souls already.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, then, those voices! and thou thyself, Will
Shakspeare!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O might I kiss the hand of my deliverer, whose
clear-sightedness throweth such manifest and plenary light upon
my innocence!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&nbsp; What light, in God&rsquo;s name, have I
thrown upon it as yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! those voices! those faeries and spirits! whence
came they?&nbsp; None can deal with &rsquo;em but the devil, the
parson, and witches.&nbsp; And does not the devil oftentimes take
the very form, features, and habiliments of knights, and bishops,
and other good men, to lead them into temptation and destroy
them? or to injure their good name, in failure of seduction?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is sure of the wicked; he lets them go their ways
out of hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think your worship once delivered some such
observation, in more courtly guise, which I would not presume to
ape.&nbsp; If it was not your worship, it was our glorious lady
the queen, or the wise Master Walsingham, or the great Lord
Cecil.&nbsp; I may have marred and broken it, as sluts do a
pancake, in the turning.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! ay, indeed, I had occasion once to remark as
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So have I heard in many places; although I was not
present when Matthew Atterend fought about it for the honour of
Kineton hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fought about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As your honour recollects.&nbsp; Not but on other
occasions he would have fought no less bravely for the
queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get thee through, were it only for thy
memory,&mdash;the most precious gift among the mental powers that
Providence hath bestowed upon us.&nbsp; I had half forgotten the
thing myself.&nbsp; Thou mayest, in time, take thy satchel for
London, and aid good old Master Holingshed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must clear thee, Will!&nbsp; I am slow to surmise
that there is blood upon thy hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His worship&rsquo;s choler had all gone down again; and he sat
as cool and comfortable as a man sitteth to be shaved.&nbsp; Then
called he on Euseby Treen, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Euseby Treen! tell us whether thou observedst anything
unnoticed or unsaid by the last witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Euseby
Treen</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing only, sir!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they had passed the water an owlet hooted after
them; and methought, if they had any fear of God before their
eyes they would have turned back, he cried so lustily.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I cannot forbear to take the owlet out of your
mouth.&nbsp; He knocks them all on the head like so many
mice.&nbsp; Likely story!&nbsp; One fellow hears him cry lustily,
the other doth not hear him at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not hear him!&nbsp; A body might have heard him at
Barford or Sherbourne.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didst not name him?&nbsp; Canst not answer
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Joseph
Carnaby</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> doubted whether punt were punt; I doubted
whether owlet were owlet, after Lucifer was away from the
roll-call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We say, <i>Speak the truth and shame the devil</i>; but
shaming him is one thing, your honour, and facing him
another!&nbsp; I have heard owlets, but never owlet like
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord be praised!&nbsp; All, at last, a-running to
my rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owlet, indeed!&nbsp; Your worship may have remembered
in an ancient book&mdash;indeed, what book is so ancient that
your worship doth not remember it?&mdash;a book printed by Doctor
Faustus&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before he dealt with the devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long before, it being the very book that made the
devil think it worth his while to deal with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What chapter thereof wouldst thou recall unto my
recollection?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That concerning owls, with the grim print afore it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Faustus, the wise doctor, who knew other than
owls and owlets, knew the tempter in that form.&nbsp; Faustus was
not your man for fancies and figments; and he tells us that, to
his certain knowledge, it was verily an owl&rsquo;s face that
whispered so much mischief in the ear of our first parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One plainly sees it, quoth Doctor Faustus, under that
gravity which in human life we call dignity, but of which we read
nothing in the Gospel.&nbsp; We despise the hangman, we detest
the hanged; and yet, saith Duns Scotus, could we turn aside the
heavy curtain, or stand high enough a-tiptoe to peep through its
chinks and crevices, we should perhaps find these two characters
to stand justly among the most innocent in the drama.&nbsp; He
who blinketh the eyes of the poor wretch about to die doeth it
out of mercy; those who preceded him, bidding him in the garb of
justice to shed the blood of his fellow-man, had less or
none.&nbsp; So they hedge well their own grounds, what care
they?&nbsp; For this do they catch at stakes and thorns, at quick
and rotten&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Master Silas interrupted the discourse of the
devil&rsquo;s own doctor, delivered and printed by him before he
was the devil&rsquo;s, to which his worship had listened very
attentively and delightedly.&nbsp; But Master Silas could keep
his temper no longer, and cried, fiercely, &ldquo;Seditious
sermonizer! hold thy peace, or thou shalt answer for &rsquo;t
before convocation.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas! thou dost not approve, then, the doctrine of
this Doctor Duns?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heretical Rabbi!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>If two of a trade can never agree</i>, yet surely
two of a name may.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who dares call me heretical? who dares call me rabbi?
who dares call me Scotus?&nbsp; Spider! spider! yea, thou hast
one corner left; I espy thee, and my broom shall reach thee
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I perceive that Master Silas doth verily believe I have
been guilty of suborning the witnesses, at least the last, the
best man (if any difference) of the two.&nbsp; No, sir, no.&nbsp;
If my family and friends have united their wits and money for
this purpose, be the crime of perverted justice on their
heads!&nbsp; They injure whom they intended to serve.&nbsp;
Improvident men!&mdash;if the young may speak thus of the
elderly; could they imagine to themselves that your worship was
to be hoodwinked and led astray?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No man shall ever dare to hoodwink me, to lead me
astray,&mdash;no, nor lead me anywise.&nbsp; Powerful
defence!&nbsp; Heyday!&nbsp; Sit quiet, Master
Treen!&mdash;Euseby Treen! dost hear me?&nbsp; Clench thy fist
again, sirrah! and I clap thee in the stocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph Carnaby! do not scratch thy breast nor thy pate
before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Joseph had not only done that in his wrath, but had
unbuckled his leathern garter, fit instrument for strife and
blood, and peradventure would have smitten, had not the knight,
with magisterial authority, interposed.</p>
<p>His worship said unto him, gravely,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph Carnaby!&nbsp; Joseph Carnaby! hast thou never
read the words &lsquo;<i>Put up thy sword</i>&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Subornation! your worship!&rdquo; cried Master
Joe.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fellow hath ne&rsquo;er a shilling in
leather or till, and many must go to suborn one like
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe it of thee,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas;
&ldquo;but patience, man! patience! he rather tended toward
exculpating thee.&nbsp; Ye have far to walk for dinner; ye may
depart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went accordingly.</p>
<p>Then did Sir Thomas say, &ldquo;These are hot men,
Silas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Master Silas did reply unto him,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are brands that would set fire to the bulrushes
in the mill-pool.&nbsp; I know these twain for quiet folks,
having coursed with them over Wincott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas then said unto William, &ldquo;It behooveth thee to
stand clear of yon Joseph, unless when thou mayest call to thy
aid the Matthew Atterend thou speakest of.&nbsp; He did then
fight valiantly, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His cause fought valiantly; his fist but seconded
it.&nbsp; He won,&mdash;proving the golden words to be no
property of our lady&rsquo;s, although her Highness hath never
disclaimed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What art thou saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I heard from a preacher at Oxford, who had preached
at Easter in the chapel-royal of Westminster.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou! why, how could that happen?&nbsp; Oxford!
chapel-royal!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to whom I said (your worship will forgive my
forwardness), &lsquo;<i>I have the honour</i>, <i>sir</i>, <i>to
live within two measured miles of the very Sir Thomas Lucy who
spake that</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I vow I said it without any hope
or belief that he would invite me, as he did, to dine with him
thereupon.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be nigh upon three miles betwixt this house and
Stratford bridge-end.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dropt a mile in my pride and exultation, God forgive
me!&nbsp; I would not conceal my fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful! that a preacher so learned as to preach
before majesty in the chapel-royal should not have caught thee
tripping over a whole lawful mile,&mdash;a good third of the
distance between my house and the cross-roads.&nbsp; This is
incomprehensible in a scholar.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God willed that he should become my teacher, and in the
bowels of his mercy hid my shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How camest thou into the converse of such eminent and
ghostly men?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, indeed?&mdash;everything against me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed, and entered into a long discourse, which Master
Silas would at sundry times have interrupted, but that Sir Thomas
more than once frowned upon him, even as he had frowned
heretofore on young Will, who thus began and continued his
narration:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearing the preacher preach at Saint Mary&rsquo;s (for
being about my father&rsquo;s business on Saturday, and not
choosing to be a-horseback on Sundays, albeit time-pressed, I
footed it to Oxford for my edification on the Lord&rsquo;s day,
leaving the sorrel with Master Hal Webster of the <i>Tankard and
Unicorn</i>)&mdash;hearing him preach, as I was saying, before
the University in St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, and hearing him use
moreover the very words that Matthew fought about, I was
impatient (God forgive me!) for the end and consummation, and I
thought I never should hear those precious words that ease every
man&rsquo;s heart, &lsquo;<i>Now to conclude</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
However, come they did.&nbsp; I hurried out among the foremost,
and thought the congratulations of the other doctors and dons
would last for ever.&nbsp; He walked sharply off, and few cared
to keep his pace,&mdash;for they are lusty men mostly; and
spiteful bad women had breathed <a name="citation89a"></a><a
href="#footnote89a" class="citation">[89a]</a> in the faces of
some among them, or the gowns had got between their legs.&nbsp;
For my part, I was not to be balked; so, tripping on aside him, I
looked in his face askance.&nbsp; Whether he misgave or how, he
turned his eyes downward.&nbsp; No matter&mdash;have him I
would.&nbsp; I licked my lips and smacked them loud and smart,
and scarcely venturing to nod, I gave my head such a sort of
motion as dace and roach give an angler&rsquo;s quill when they
begin to bite.&nbsp; And this fairly hooked him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Young gentleman!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;where is
your gown?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Reverend sir!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I am
unworthy to wear one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A proper youth, nevertheless, and mightily
well-spoken!&rsquo; he was pleased to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your reverence hath given me heart, which failed
me,&rsquo; was my reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah! your reverence! those
words about the devil were spicy words; but, under favour, I do
know the brook-side they sprang and flowered by.&nbsp; &rsquo;T
is just where it runs into Avon; &rsquo;t is called
Hogbrook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Right!&rsquo; quoth he, putting his hand gently
on my shoulder; &lsquo;but if I had thought it needful to say so
in my sermon, I should have affronted the seniors of the
University, since many claim them, and some peradventure would
fain transpose them into higher places, and giving up all right
and title to them, would accept in lieu thereof the poor
recompense of a mitre.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wished (unworthy wish for a Sunday!) I had Matthew
Atterend in the midst of them.&nbsp; He would have given them
skulls mitre-fashioned, if mitres are cloven now as we see them
on ancient monuments.&nbsp; Matt is your milliner for gentles,
who think no more harm of purloining rich saws in a mitre than
lane-born boys do of embezzling hazel-nuts in a woollen
cap.&nbsp; I did not venture to expound or suggest my thoughts,
but feeling my choler rise higher and higher, I craved permission
to make my obeisance and depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where dost thou lodge, young man?&rsquo; said
the preacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At the public,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;where my
father customarily lodgeth.&nbsp; There, too, is a mitre of the
old fashion, swinging on the sign-post in the middle of the
street.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Respectable tavern enough!&rsquo; quoth the
reverend doctor; &lsquo;and worthy men do turn in there, even
quality,&mdash;Master Davenant, Master Powel, Master Whorwood,
aged and grave men.&nbsp; But taverns are Satan&rsquo;s chapels,
and are always well attended on the Lord&rsquo;s day, to twit
him.&nbsp; Hast thou no friend in such a city as
Oxford?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Only the landlady of the Mitre,&rsquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A comely woman,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;but too
young for business by half.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stay thou with me to-day, and fare frugally, but
safely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What may thy name be, and where is thy
abode?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;William Shakspeare, of Stratford-upon-Avon, at
your service, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And welcome,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;thy father
ere now hath bought our college wool.&nbsp; A truly good man we
ever found him; and I doubt not he hath educated his son to
follow him in his paths.&nbsp; There is in the blood of man, as
in the blood of animals, that which giveth the temper and
disposition.&nbsp; These require nurture and culture.&nbsp; But
what nurture will turn flint-stones into garden mould? or what
culture rear cabbages in the quarries of Hedington Hill?&nbsp; To
be well born is the greatest of all God&rsquo;s primary
blessings, young man, and there are many well born among the poor
and needy.&nbsp; Thou art not of the indigent and destitute, who
have great temptations; thou art not of the wealthy and affluent,
who have greater still.&nbsp; God hath placed thee, William
Shakspeare, in that pleasant island, on one side whereof are the
sirens, on the other the harpies, but inhabiting the coasts on
the wider continent, and unable to make their talons felt, or
their voices heard by thee.&nbsp; Unite with me in prayer and
thanksgiving for the blessings thus vouchsafed.&nbsp; We must not
close the heart when the finger of God would touch it.&nbsp;
Enough, if thou sayest only, <i>My soul</i>, <i>praise thou the
Lord</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas said, &ldquo;<i>Amen</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Master Silas
was mute for the moment, but then quoth he, &ldquo;I can say amen
too in the proper place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knight of Charlecote, who appeared to have been much taken
with this conversation, then interrogated Willy:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What farther might have been thy discourse with the
doctor? or did he discourse at all at trencher-time?&nbsp; Thou
must have been very much abashed to sit down at table with one
who weareth a pure lambskin across his shoulder, and moreover a
pink hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith! was I, your honour! and could neither utter nor
gulp.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are good signs.&nbsp; Thou hast not lost all
grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the encouragement of Dr. Glaston&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was it Dr. Glaston?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said I not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The learnedst clerk in Christendom! a very Friar
Bacon!&nbsp; The Pope offered a hundred marks in Latin to who
should eviscerate or evirate him,&mdash;poisons very potent,
whereat the Italians are handy,&mdash;so apostolic and desperate
a doctor is Doctor Glaston! so acute in his quiddities, and so
resolute in his bearing!&nbsp; He knows the dark arts, but stands
aloof from them.&nbsp; Prithee, what were his words unto
thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manna, sir, manna! pure from the desert!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but what spake he? for most sermons are that, and
likewise many conversations after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He spake of the various races and qualities of men, as
before stated; but chiefly on the elect and reprobate, and how to
distinguish and know them.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he go so far?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me that by such discussion he should say enough
to keep me constantly out of evil company.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See there! see there! and yet thou art come before
me!&mdash;Can nothing warn thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare not dissemble, nor feign, nor hold aught back,
although it be to my confusion.&nbsp; As well may I speak at once
the whole truth for your worship could find it out if I
abstained.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, that I should indeed, and shortly.&nbsp; But, come
now, I am sated of thy follies and roguish tricks, and yearn
after the sound doctrine of that pious man.&nbsp; What expounded
the grave Glaston upon signs and tokens whereby ye shall be
known?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful things! things beyond belief!&nbsp;
&lsquo;There be certain men,&rsquo; quoth he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He began well.&nbsp; This promises.&nbsp; But why canst
not thou go on?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There be certain men, who, rubbing one corner of
the eye, do see a peacock&rsquo;s feather at the other, and even
fire.&nbsp; We know, William, what that fire is, and whence it
cometh.&nbsp; Those wicked men, William, all have their marks
upon them, be it only a corn, or a wart, or a mole, or a hairy
ear, or a toe-nail turned inward.&nbsp; Sufficient, and more than
sufficient!&nbsp; He knoweth his own by less tokens.&nbsp; There
is not one of them that doth not sweat at some secret sin
committed, or some inclination toward it unsnaffled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Certain men are there, likewise, who venerate so
little the glorious works of the Creator that I myself have known
them to sneeze at the sun!&nbsp; Sometimes it was against their
will, and they would gladly have checked it had they been able;
but they were forced to shew what they are.&nbsp; In our carnal
state we say, <i>What is one against numbers</i>?&nbsp; In
another we shall truly say, <i>What are numbers against
one</i>?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas did ejaculate, &ldquo;<i>Amen</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Amen</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then his lips moved silently,
piously, and quickly; and then said he, audibly and
loudly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And make us at last true Israelites</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After which he turned to young Willy, and said,
anxiously,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast thou more, lad? give us it while the Lord
strengtheneth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Willy, &ldquo;although I thought
it no trouble, on my return to the <i>Mitre</i>, to write down
every word I could remember, and although few did then escape me,
yet at this present I can bring to mind but scanty sentences, and
those so stray and out of order that they would only prove my
incapacity for sterling wisdom, and my incontinence of spiritual
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even that sentence hath a twang of the doctor in
it.&nbsp; Nothing is so sweet as humility.&nbsp; The mountains
may descend, but the valleys cannot rise.&nbsp; Every man should
know himself.&nbsp; Come, repeat what thou canst.&nbsp; I would
fain have three or four more heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not whether I can give your worship more than
one other.&nbsp; Let me try.&nbsp; It was when Doctor Glaston was
discoursing on the protection the wise and powerful should afford
to the ignorant and weak:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the earlier ages of mankind, your Greek and
Latin authors inform you, there went forth sundry worthies, men
of might, to deliver, not wandering damsels, albeit for those
likewise they had stowage, but low-conditioned men, who fell
under the displeasure of the higher, and groaned in thraldom and
captivity.&nbsp; And these mighty ones were believed to have done
such services to poor humanity that their memory grew greater
than they, as shadows do than substances at day-fall.&nbsp; And
the sons and grandsons of the delivered did laud and magnify
those glorious names; and some in gratitude, and some in
tribulation, did ascend the hills, which appeared unto them as
altars bestrown with flowers and herbage for heaven&rsquo;s
acceptance.&nbsp; And many did go far into the quiet groves,
under lofty trees, looking for whatever was mightiest and most
protecting.&nbsp; And in such places did they cry aloud unto the
mighty who had left them, &ldquo;<i>Return</i>! <i>return</i>!
<i>help us</i>! <i>help us</i>! <i>be blessed</i>! <i>for ever
blessed</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Vain men! but had they stayed there, not
evil.&nbsp; Out of gratitude, purest gratitude, rose
idolatry.&nbsp; For the devil sees the fairest, and soils it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In these our days, methinks, whatever other sins
we may fall into, such idolatry is the least dangerous.&nbsp; For
neither on the one side is there much disposition for gratitude,
nor on the other much zeal to deliver the innocent and
oppressed.&nbsp; Even this deliverance, although a merit, and a
high one, is not the highest.&nbsp; Forgiveness is beyond
it.&nbsp; Forgive, or ye shall not be forgiven.&nbsp; This ye may
do every day; for if ye find not offences, ye feign them; and
surely ye may remove your own work, if ye may re-remove
another&rsquo;s.&nbsp; To rescue requires more thought and
wariness; learn, then, the easier lesson first.&nbsp; Afterward,
when ye rescue any from another&rsquo;s violence, or from his own
(which oftentimes is more dangerous, as the enemies are within
not only the penetrals of his house but of his heart), bind up
his wounds before ye send him on his way.&nbsp; Should ye at any
time overtake the erring, and resolve to deliver him up, I will
tell you whither to conduct him.&nbsp; Conduct him to his Lord
and Master, whose household he hath left.&nbsp; It is better to
consign him to Christ his Saviour than to man his murderer; it is
better to bid him live than to bid him die.&nbsp; The one word
our Teacher and Preserver said, the other our enemy and
destroyer.&nbsp; Bring him back again, the stray, the lost one
bring him back, not with clubs and cudgels, not with halberts and
halters, but generously and gently, and with the linking of the
arm.&nbsp; In this posture shall God above smile upon ye; in this
posture of yours he shall recognize again his beloved Son upon
earth.&nbsp; Do ye likewise, and depart in
peace.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>William had ended, and there was silence in the hall for some
time after, when Sir Thomas said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He spake unto somewhat mean persons, who may do it
without disparagement.&nbsp; I look for authority, I look for
doctrine, and find none yet.&nbsp; If he could not have drawn us
out a thread or two from the coat of an apostle, he might have
given us a smack of Augustin, or a sprig of Basil.&nbsp; Our
older sermons are headier than these, Master Silas! our new beer
is the sweeter and clammier, and wants more spice.&nbsp; The
doctor hath seasoned his with pretty wit enough, to do him
justice, which in a sermon is never out of place; for if there be
the bane, there likewise is the antidote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dost thou think about it, Master Silas?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not give ten farthings for ten folios of such
sermons.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These words, Master Silas, will oftener be quoted than
any others of thine; but rarely (do I suspect) as applicable to
Doctor Glaston.&nbsp; I must stick unto his gown.&nbsp; I must
declare that, to my poor knowledge, many have been raised to the
bench of bishops for less wisdom and worse than is contained in
the few sentences I have been commanded by authority to
recite.&nbsp; No disparagement to any body I know, Master Silas,
and multitudes bear witness, that thou above most art a dead hand
at a sermon.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Touch my sermons, wilt dare?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Master Silas, be not angered; it is courage enough
to hear them.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Silas, hold thy peace and rest contented.&nbsp; He
hath excused himself unto thee, throwing in a compliment far
above his station, and not unworthy of Rome or Florence.&nbsp; I
did not think him so ready.&nbsp; Our Warwickshire lads are
fitter for football than courtesies; and, sooth to say, not only
the inferior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His worship turned from Master Silas toward William, and said,
&ldquo;Brave Willy, thou hast given us our bitters; we are ready
now for any thing solid.&nbsp; What hast left?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little or nothing, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, give us that little or nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Shakspeare was obedient to the commands of Sir Thomas,
who had spoken thus kindly unto him, and had deigned to cast at
him from his <i>lordly dish</i> (as the Psalmist hath it) a
fragment of facetiousness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, sir! may I repeat it without offence, it not
being doctrine but admonition, and meant for me only?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak it the rather for that,&rdquo; quoth Sir
Thomas.</p>
<p>Then did William give utterance to the words of the preacher,
not indeed in his sermon at St. Mary&rsquo;s, but after
dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lust seizeth us in youth, ambition in midlife,
avarice in old age; but vanity and pride are the besetting sins
that drive the angels from our cradle, pamper us with luscious
and most unwholesome food, ride our first stick with us, mount
our first horse with us, wake with us in the morning, dream with
us in the night, and never at any time abandon us.&nbsp; In this
world, beginning with pride and vanity, we are delivered over
from tormentor to tormentor, until the worst tormentor of all
taketh absolute possession of us for ever, seizing us at the
mouth of the grave, enchaining us in his own dark dungeon,
standing at the door, and laughing at our cries.&nbsp; But the
Lord, out of his infinite mercy, hath placed in the hand of every
man the helm to steer his course by, pointing it out with his
finger, and giving him strength as well as knowledge to pursue
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;William! William! there is in the moral straits
a current from right to wrong, but no re-flux from wrong to
right; for which destination we must hoist our sails aloft and
ply our oars incessantly, or night and the tempest will overtake
us, and we shall shriek out in vain from the billows, and
irrecoverably sink.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; cried Sir Thomas most devoutly, sustaining
his voice long and loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open that casement, good Silas! the day is sultry for
the season of the year; it approacheth unto noontide.&nbsp; The
room is close, and those blue flies do make a strange
hubbub.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In troth do they, sir; they come from the kitchen, and
do savour woundily of roast goose!&nbsp; And,
methinks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bethinkest thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fancy of a moment,&mdash;a light and vain
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou relievest me; speak it!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could the creatures cast their coarse rank odour
thus far?&mdash;even into your presence!&nbsp; A noble and
spacious hall!&nbsp; Charlecote, in my mind, beats Warwick
Castle, and challenges Kenilworth.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hall is well enough; I must say it is a noble
hall,&mdash;a hall for a queen to sit down in.&nbsp; And I
stuffed an arm-chair with horse-hair on purpose, feathers over
it, swan-down over them again, and covered it with scarlet cloth
of Bruges, five crowns the short ell.&nbsp; But her highness came
not hither; she was taken short; she had a tongue in her
ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where all is spring, all is buzz and murmur.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quaint and solid as the best yew hedge.&nbsp; I marvel
at thee.&nbsp; A knight might have spoken it, under favour.&nbsp;
They stopped her at Warwick&mdash;to see what? two old towers
that don&rsquo;t match, <a name="citation105a"></a><a
href="#footnote105a" class="citation">[105a]</a> and a portcullis
that (people say) opens only upon fast-days.&nbsp; Charlecote
Hall, I could have told her sweet Highness, was built by those
Lucys who came over with Julius C&aelig;sar and William the
Conqueror, with cross and scallop-shell on breast and
beaver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, <i>honest Willy</i>!?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the very words; I wrote them down with two signs in
the margent,&mdash;one a mark of admiration, as thus (!), the
other of interrogation (so we call it) as thus (?).</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, honest Willy, I would fain hear more,&rdquo; quoth
he, &ldquo;about the learned Doctor Glaston.&nbsp; He seemeth to
be a man after God&rsquo;s own heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay is he!&nbsp; Never doth he sit down to dinner but he
readeth first a chapter of the Revelation; and if he tasteth a
pound of butter at Carfax, he saith a grace long enough to bring
an appetite for a baked bull&rsquo;s <a
name="citation106a"></a><a href="#footnote106a"
class="citation">[106a]</a> &mdash;zle.&nbsp; If this be not
after God&rsquo;s own heart, I know not what is.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would fain confer with him, but that Oxford lieth
afar off,&mdash;a matter of thirty miles, I hear.&nbsp; I might,
indeed, write unto him; but our Warwickshire pens are mighty
broad-nibbed, and there is a something in this plaguy ink of ours
sadly ropy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear there is,&rdquo; quoth Willy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I should scorn,&rdquo; continued his worship,
&ldquo;to write otherwise than in a fine Italian character to the
master of a college, near in dignity to knighthood.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worshipful sir! is there no other way of communicating
but by person, or writing, or messages?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will consider and devise.&nbsp; At present I can
think of none so satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now did the great clock over the gateway strike.&nbsp; And
Bill Shakspeare did move his lips, even as Sir Thomas had moved
his erewhile in ejaculating.&nbsp; And when he had wagged them
twice or thrice after the twelve strokes of the clock were over,
again he ejaculated with voice also, saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy upon us! how the day wears!&nbsp; Twelve
strokes!&nbsp; Might I retire, please your worship, into the
chapel for about three quarters of an hour, and perform the
service <a name="citation108a"></a><a href="#footnote108a"
class="citation">[108a]</a> as ordained?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Sir Thomas could give him leave or answer, did Sir
Silas cry aloud,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would purloin the chalice, worth forty-eight
shillings, and melt it down in the twinkling of an eye, he is so
crafty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the knight was more reasonable, and said,
reprovingly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now, Silas! thou talkest widely, and verily in
malice, if there be any in thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try him,&rdquo; answered Master Silas; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t kneel where he does.&nbsp; Could he have but his
wicked will of me he would chop my legs off, as he did the poor
buck&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no; he hath neither guile nor revenge in
him.&nbsp; We may let him have his way, now that he hath taken
the right one.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Popery! sheer popery! strong as harts-horn!&nbsp; Your
papists keep these outlandish hours for their masses and
mummery.&nbsp; Surely we might let God alone at twelve
o&rsquo;clock!&nbsp; Have we no bowels?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious sir!&nbsp; I do not urge it; and the time is
now past by some minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art thou popishly inclined, William?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I am not popishly inclined; I am not inclined to
pay tribute of coin or understanding to those who rush forward
with a pistol at my breast, crying, &lsquo;<i>Stand</i>, <i>or
you are a dead man</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have but one guide in
faith,&mdash;a powerful, an almighty one.&nbsp; He will not
suffer to waste away and vanish the faith for which he
died.&nbsp; He hath chosen in all countries pure hearts for its
depositaries; and I would rather take it from a friend and
neighbour, intelligent and righteous, and rejecting lucre, than
from some foreigner educated in the pride of cities or in the
moroseness of monasteries, who sells me what Christ gave
me,&mdash;his own flesh and blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can repeat by heart what I read above a year agone,
albeit I cannot bring to mind the title of the book in which I
read it.&nbsp; These are the words,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The most venal and sordid of all the
superstitions that have swept and darkened our globe may, indeed,
like African locusts, have consumed the green corn in very
extensive regions, and may return periodically to consume it; but
the strong, unwearied labourer who sowed it hath alway sown it in
other places less exposed to such devouring pestilences.&nbsp;
Those cunning men who formed to themselves the gorgeous plan of
universal dominion were aware that they had a better chance of
establishing it than brute ignorance or brute force could supply,
and that soldiers and their paymasters were subject to other and
powerfuller fears than the transitory ones of war and
invasion.&nbsp; What they found in heaven they seized; what they
wanted they forged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And so long as there is vice and ignorance in
the world, so long as fear is a passion, their dominion will
prevail; but their dominion is not, and never shall be,
universal.&nbsp; Can we wonder that it is so general?&nbsp; Can
we wonder that anything is wanting to give it authority and
effect, when every learned, every prudent, every powerful, every
ambitious man in Europe, for above a thousand years, united in
the league to consolidate it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The old dealers in the shambles, where
Christ&rsquo;s body is exposed for sale in convenient marketable
slices, <a name="citation111a"></a><a href="#footnote111a"
class="citation">[111a]</a> have not covered with blood and filth
the whole pavement.&nbsp; Beautiful usages are remaining
still,&mdash;kindly affections, radiant hopes, and ardent
aspirations!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is a comfortable thing to reflect, as they
do, and as we may do unblamably, that we are uplifting to our
Guide and Maker the same incense of the heart, and are uttering
the very words, which our dearest friends in all quarters of the
earth, nay in heaven itself, are offering to the throne of grace
at the same moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thus are we together through the immensity of
space.&nbsp; What are these bodies?&nbsp; Do they unite us?&nbsp;
No; they keep us apart and asunder even while we touch.&nbsp;
Realms and oceans, worlds and ages, open before two spirits bent
on heaven.&nbsp; What a choir surrounds us when we resolve to
live unitedly and harmoniously in Christian
faith!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Silas, what sayest thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ignorant fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ignorant fools are bearable, Master Silas! your wise
ones are the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prithee no bandying of loggerheads.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Or else what mortal man shall say<br />
Whose shins may suffer in the fray?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou reasonest aptly and timest well.&nbsp; And surely,
being now in so rational and religious a frame of mind, thou
couldst recall to memory a section or head or two of the sermon
holden at St. Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It would do thee and us as much
good as <i>Lighten our darkness</i>, or <i>Forasmuch as it hath
pleased</i>; and somewhat less than three quarters of an hour
(maybe less than one quarter) sufficeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or he hangs without me.&nbsp; I am for dinner in half
the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas!&nbsp; Silas! he hangeth not with thee or without
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinketh himself a clever fellow; but he (look ye)
is the cleverest that gets off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hold quite the contrary,&rdquo; quoth Will
Shakspeare, winking at Master Silas from the comfort and
encouragement he had just received touching the hanging.</p>
<p>And Master Silas had his answer ready, and shewed that he was
more than a match for poor Willy in wit and poetry.</p>
<p>He answered thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;If winks are wit,<br />
Who wanteth it?</p>
<p>Thou hadst other bolts to kill bucks withal.&nbsp; In wit,
sirrah, thou art a mere child.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little dogs are jealous of children, great ones fondle
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An that were written in the Apocrypha, in the very
teeth of Bel and the Dragon, it could not be truer.&nbsp; I have
witnessed it with my own eyes over and over.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will take this for wit, likewise, now the arms of
Lucy do seal it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas, they may stamp wit, they may further wit, they
may send wit into good company, but not make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold my wall of defence!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An thou art for walls, I have one for thee from Oxford,
pithy and apposite, sound and solid, and trimmed up becomingly,
as a collar of brawn with a crown of rosemary, or a boar&rsquo;s
head with a lemon in the mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egad, Master Silas, those are your walls for lads to
climb over, an they were higher than Babel&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have at thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Thou art a wall<br />
To make the ball<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rebound from.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Thou hast a back<br />
For beadle&rsquo;s crack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To sound from, to sound from.</p>
<p>The foolishest dolts are the ground-plot of the most wit, as
the idlest rogues are of the most industry.&nbsp; Even thou hast
brought wit down from Oxford.&nbsp; And before a thief is hanged,
parliament must make laws, attorneys must engross them, printers
stamp and publish them, hawkers cry them, judges expound them,
juries weigh and measure them with offences, then executioners
carry them into effect.&nbsp; The farmer hath already sown the
hemp, the ropemaker hath twisted it; sawyers saw the timber,
carpenters tack together the shell, grave-diggers delve the
earth.&nbsp; And all this truly for fellows like unto
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom a God came down from heaven to save.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas! he hangeth not.&nbsp; William, I must have the
heads of the sermon, six or seven of &rsquo;em; thou hast whetted
my appetite keenly.&nbsp; How! dost duck thy pate into thy hat?
nay, nay, that is proper and becoming at church; we need not such
solemnity.&nbsp; Repeat unto us the setting forth at St.
Mary&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon did William Shakspeare entreat of Master Silas that
he would help him in his ghostly endeavours, by repeating what he
called the <i>preliminary</i> prayer; which prayer I find nowhere
in our ritual, and do suppose it to be one of those Latin
supplications used in our learned universities now or
erewhile.</p>
<p>I am afeard it hath not the approbation of the strictly
orthodox, for inasmuch as Master Silas at such entreaty did close
his teeth against it, and with teeth thus closed did say,
Athanasiuswise, &ldquo;Go and be damned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill was not disheartened, but said he hoped better, and began
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My brethren!&rsquo; said the preacher, &lsquo;or
rather let me call you my children, such is my age confronted
with yours, for the most part,&mdash;my children, then, and my
brethren (for here are both), believe me, killing is
forbidden.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, not being delivered unto us from the pulpit by
the preacher himself, we may look into.&nbsp; Sensible man!
shrewd reasoner!&nbsp; What a stroke against deer-stealers! how
full of truth and ruth!&nbsp; Excellent discourse!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last part was the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always find it so.&nbsp; The softest of the
cheesecake is left in the platter when the crust is eaten.&nbsp;
He kept the best bit for the last, then?&nbsp; He pushed it under
the salt, eh?&nbsp; He told thee&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ye shall not kill.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I did he run in a circle like a hare?&nbsp; One of
his mettle should break cover and off across the country like a
fox or hart.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And yet ye kill time when ye can, and are uneasy
when ye cannot.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon did Sir Thomas say, aside unto himself, but within
my hearing,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith and troth! he must have had a head in at the
window here one day or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This sin cryeth unto the Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was wrong there.&nbsp; It is not one of those that
cry; mortal sins cry.&nbsp; Surely he could not have fallen into
such an error! it must be thine; thou misunderstoodest
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mayhap, sir!&nbsp; A great heaviness came over me; I
was oppressed in spirit, and did feel as one awakening from a
dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Godlier men than thou art do often feel the right hand
of the Lord upon their heads in like manner.&nbsp; It followeth
contrition, and precedeth conversion.&nbsp; Continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My brethren and children,&rsquo; said the
teacher, &lsquo;whenever ye want to kill time call God to the
chase, and bid the angels blow the horn; and thus ye are sure to
kill time to your heart&rsquo;s content.&nbsp; And ye may feast
another day, and another after that&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said Master Silas unto me, concernedly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the mischief-fullest of all the devil&rsquo;s
imps, to talk in such wise at a quarter past twelve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But William went straight on, not hearing him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&mdash;upon what ye shall, in such pursuit, have
brought home with you.&nbsp; Whereas, if ye go alone, or two or
three together, nay, even if ye go in thick and gallant company,
and yet provide not that these be with ye, my word for it, and a
powerfuller word than mine, ye shall return to your supper tired
and jaded, and rest little when ye want to rest
most.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast no other head of the Doctor&rsquo;s?&rdquo; quoth
Sir Thomas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily none,&rdquo; replied Willy, &ldquo;of the
morning&rsquo;s discourse, saving the last words of it, which,
with God&rsquo;s help, I shall always remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us them, give us them,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants doctrine; he wants authority; his are grains
of millet,&mdash;grains for unfledged doves; but they are sound,
except the <i>crying</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deliver unto us the last words; for the last of the
preacher, as of the hanged, are usually the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then did William repeat the concluding words of the discourse,
being these:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As years are running past us, let us throw
something on them which they cannot shake off in the dust and
hurry of the world, but must carry with them to that great year
of all, whereunto the lesser of this mortal life do tend and are
subservient.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, after a pause, and after having bent his knee
under the table, as though there had been the church-cushion,
said unto us,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he spake <i>through a glass</i>, <i>darkly</i>, as
blessed Paul hath it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turning toward Willy,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nothing more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but the <i>glory</i>,&rdquo; quoth Willy,
&ldquo;at which there is always such a clatter of feet upon the
floor, and creaking of benches, and rustling of gowns, and bustle
of bonnets, and justle of cushions, and dust of mats, and
treading of toes, and punching of elbows, from the spitefuller,
that one wishes to be fairly out of it, after the scramble for
<i>the peace of God</i> is at an end&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas threw himself back upon his armchair, and exclaimed
in wonderment, &ldquo;How!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and in the midst of the service again, were it
possible.&nbsp; For nothing is painfuller than to have the pail
shaken off the head when it is brim-full of the waters of life,
and we are walking staidly under it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had the learned Doctor preached again in the evening,
pursuing the thread of his discourse, he might, peradventure,
have made up the deficiencies I find in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had not that opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more&rsquo;s the pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evening admonition, delivered by him unto the
household&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! and did he indeed shew wind enough for
that?&nbsp; Prithee out with it, if thou didst put it into thy
tablets.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alack, sir! there were so many Latin words, I fear me I
should be at fault in such attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear not; we can help thee out between us, were there a
dozen or a score.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bating those latinities, I do verily think I could tie
up again most of the points in his doublet.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At him then!&nbsp; What was his bearing?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In dividing his matter, he spooned out and apportioned
the commons in his discourse, as best suited the quality,
capacity, and constitution of his hearers.&nbsp; To those in
priests&rsquo; orders he delivered a sort of
catechism.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He catechise grown men!&nbsp; He catechise men in
priests&rsquo; orders!&mdash;being no bishop, nor bishop&rsquo;s
ordinary!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did so; it may be at his peril.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what else? for catechisms are baby&rsquo;s
pap.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not catechise, but he admonished the richer
gentlemen with gold tassels for their top-knots.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much.&nbsp; It was no better in my
time.&nbsp; Admonitions fell gently upon those gold tassels; and
they ripened degrees as glass and sunshine ripen cucumbers.&nbsp;
We priests, forsooth, are catechised!&nbsp; The worst question to
any gold tasseller is, &lsquo;<i>How do you do</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Old <i>Alma Mater</i> coaxes and would be coaxed.&nbsp; But let
her look sharp, or spectacles may be thrust upon her nose that
shall make her eyes water.&nbsp; Aristotle could make out no
royal road to wisdom; but this old woman of ours will shew you
one, an you tip her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tilley valley! <a name="citation124a"></a><a
href="#footnote124a" class="citation">[124a]</a> catechise
priests, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peradventure he did it discreetly.&nbsp; Let us examine
and judge him.&nbsp; Repeat thou what he said unto
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Many,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;are ingenuous, many
are devout, some timidly, some strenuously, but nearly all
flinch, and rear, and kick, at the slightest touch, or least
inquisitive suspicion of an unsound part in their doctrine.&nbsp;
And yet, my brethren, we ought rather to flinch and feel sore at
our own searching touch, our own serious inquisition into
ourselves.&nbsp; Let us preachers, who are sufficiently liberal
in bestowing our advice upon others, inquire of ourselves whether
the exercise of spiritual authority may not be sometimes too
pleasant, tickling our breasts with a plume from Satan&rsquo;s
wing, and turning our heads with that inebriating poison which he
hath been seen to instil into the very chalice of our
salvation.&nbsp; Let us ask ourselves in the closet whether,
after we have humbled ourselves before God in our prayers, we
never rise beyond the due standard in the pulpit; whether our
zeal for the truth be never over-heated by internal fires less
holy; whether we never grow stiffly and sternly pertinacious, at
the very time when we are reproving the obstinacy of others; and
whether we have not frequently so acted as if we believed that
opposition were to be relaxed and borne away by self-sufficiency
and intolerance.&nbsp; Believe me, the wisest of us have our
catechism to learn; and these, my dear friends, are not the only
questions contained in it.&nbsp; No Christian can hate; no
Christian can malign.&nbsp; Nevertheless, do we not often both
hate and malign those unhappy men who are insensible to
God&rsquo;s mercies?&nbsp; And I fear this unchristian spirit
swells darkly, with all its venom, in the marble of our hearts,
not because our brother is insensible to these mercies, but
because he is insensible to our faculty of persuasion, turning a
deaf ear unto our claim upon his obedience, or a blind or sleepy
eye upon the fountain of light, whereof we deem ourselves the
sacred reservoirs.&nbsp; There is one more question at which ye
will tremble when ye ask it in the recesses of your souls; I do
tremble at it, yet must utter it.&nbsp; Whether we do not more
warmly and erectly stand up for God&rsquo;s word because it came
from our mouths, than because it came from his?&nbsp; Learned and
ingenious men may indeed find a solution and excuse for all these
propositions; but the wise unto salvation will cry,
&ldquo;Forgive me, O my God, if, called by thee to walk in thy
way, I have not swept this dust from the
sanctuary!&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this, methinks, is for the behoof of clerks and
ministers.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He taught them what they who teach others should learn
and practise.&nbsp; Then did he look toward the young gentlemen
of large fortune; and lastly his glances fell upon us poorer
folk, whom he instructed in the duty we owe to our
superiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, there he had a host.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one part of his admonition he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Young gentlemen! let not the highest of you who
hear me this evening be led into the delusion, for such it is,
that the founder of his family was <i>originally</i> a greater or
a better man than the lowest here.&nbsp; He willed it, and became
it.&nbsp; He must have stood low; he must have worked
hard,&mdash;and with tools, moreover, of his own invention and
fashioning.&nbsp; He waved and whistled off ten thousand strong
and importunate temptations; he dashed the dice-box from the
jewelled hand of Chance, the cup from Pleasure&rsquo;s, and trod
under foot the sorceries of each; he ascended steadily the
precipices of Danger, and looked down with intrepidity from the
summit; he overawed Arrogance with Sedateness; he seized by the
horn and overleaped low Violence; and he fairly swung Fortune
round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The very high cannot rise much higher; the very
low may,&mdash;the truly great must have done it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is not the doctrine, my friends, of the
silkenly and lawnly religious; it wears the coarse texture of the
fisherman, and walks uprightly and straightforward under
it.&nbsp; I am speaking now more particularly to you among us
upon whom God hath laid the incumbrances of wealth, the sweets
whereof bring teazing and poisonous things about you, not easily
sent away.&nbsp; What now are your pretensions under sacks of
money? or your enjoyments under the shade of genealogical
trees?&nbsp; Are they rational?&nbsp; Are they real?&nbsp; Do
they exist at all?&nbsp; Strange inconsistency! to be proud of
having as much gold and silver laid upon you as a mule hath, and
yet to carry it less composedly!&nbsp; The mule is not answerable
for the conveyance and discharge of his burden,&mdash;you
are.&nbsp; Stranger infatuation still! to be prouder of an
excellent thing done by another than by yourselves, supposing any
excellent thing to have actually been done; and, after all, to be
more elated on his cruelties than his kindnesses, by the blood he
hath spilt than by the benefits he had conferred; and to
acknowledge less obligation to a well-informed and
well-intentioned progenitor than to a lawless and ferocious
barbarian.&nbsp; Would stocks and stumps, if they could utter
words, utter such gross stupidity?&nbsp; Would the apple boast of
his crab origin, or the peach of his prune?&nbsp; Hardly any man
is ashamed of being inferior to his ancestors, although it is the
very thing at which the great should blush, if, indeed, the great
in general descended from the worthy.&nbsp; I did expect to see
the day, and although I shall not see it, it must come at last,
when he shall be treated as a madman or an impostor who dares to
claim nobility or precedency and cannot shew his family name in
the history of his country.&nbsp; Even he who can shew it, and
who cannot write his own under it in the same or as goodly
characters, must submit to the imputation of degeneracy, from
which the lowly and obscure are exempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He alone who maketh you wiser maketh you
greater; and it is only by such an implement that Almighty God
himself effects it.&nbsp; When he taketh away a man&rsquo;s
wisdom he taketh away his strength, his power over others and
over himself.&nbsp; What help for him then?&nbsp; He may sit idly
and swell his spleen, saying,&mdash;<i>Who is this</i>? <i>who is
that</i>? and at the question&rsquo;s end the spirit of inquiry
dies away in him.&nbsp; It would not have been so if, in happier
hour, he had said within himself, <i>Who am I</i>? <i>what am
I</i>? and had prosecuted the search in good earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When we ask who <i>this</i> man is, or who
<i>that</i> man is, we do not expect or hope for a plain answer;
we should be disappointed at a direct, or a rational, or a kind
one.&nbsp; We desire to hear that he was of low origin, or had
committed some crime, or been subjected to some calamity.&nbsp;
Whoever he be, in general we disregard or despise him, unless we
discover that he possesseth by nature many qualities of mind and
body which he never brings into use, and many accessories of
situation and fortune which he brings into abuse every day.&nbsp;
According to the arithmetic in practice, he who makes the most
idlers and the most ingrates is the most worshipful.&nbsp; But
wiser ones than the scorers in this school will tell you how
riches and power were bestowed by Providence that generosity and
mercy should be exercised; for, if every gift of the Almighty
were distributed in equal portions to every creature, less of
such virtues would be called into the field; consequently there
would be less of gratitude, less of submission, less of devotion,
less of hope, and, in the total, less of
content.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he ceased, and Sir Thomas nodded, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reasonable enough! nay, almost too
reasonable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are the apostles?&nbsp; Where are the
disciples?&nbsp; Where are the saints?&nbsp; Where is
hell-fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! patience! we may come to it yet.&nbsp; Go on,
Will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With such encouragement before him, did Will Shakspeare take
breath and continue:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We mortals are too much accustomed to behold our
superiors in rank and station as we behold the leaves in the
forest.&nbsp; While we stand under these leaves, our protection
and refuge from heat and labour, we see only the rougher side of
them, and the gloominess of the branches on which they
hang.&nbsp; In the midst of their benefits we are insensible to
their utility and their beauty, and appear to be ignorant that if
they were placed less high above us we should derive from them
less advantage.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay; envy of superiority made the angels kick and run
restive.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it please your worship! with all my faults, I have
ever borne due submission and reverence toward my
superiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very right! very scriptural!&nbsp; But most folks do
that.&nbsp; Our duty is not fulfilled unless we bear absolute
veneration; unless we are ready to lay down our lives and
fortunes at the foot of the throne, and every thing else at the
foot of those who administer the laws under virgin
majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honoured sir!&nbsp; I am quite ready to lay down my
life and fortune, and all the rest of me, before that great
virgin.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy life and fortune, to wit!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they worth?&nbsp; A June cob-nut, maggot and
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas, we will not repudiate nor rebuff his Magdalen,
that bringeth a pot of ointment.&nbsp; Rather let us teach and
tutor than twit.&nbsp; It is a tractable and conducible youth,
being in good company.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teach and tutor!&nbsp; Hold hard, sir!&nbsp; These base
varlets ought to be taught but two things: to bow as beseemeth
them to their betters, and to hang perpendicular.&nbsp; We have
authority for it, that no man can add an inch to his stature; but
by aid of the sheriff I engage to find a chap who shall add two
or three to this whoreson&rsquo;s.&rdquo; <a
name="citation133a"></a><a href="#footnote133a"
class="citation">[133a]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, now, Silas! the lad&rsquo;s mother was always
held to be an honest woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His mother may be an honest woman for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William

<p>&ldquo;No small privilege, by my faith! for any woman in the
next parish to thee, Master Silas!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There again! out comes the filthy runlet from the
quagmire, that but now lay so quiet with all its own in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until it was trodden on by the ass that could not leap
over it.&nbsp; These, I think, are the words of the
fable.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are so.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fable?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tush! don&rsquo;t press him too hard; he wants not wit,
but learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants a rope&rsquo;s-end; and a rope&rsquo;s-end is
not enough for him, unless we throw in the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peradventure he may be an instrument, a potter&rsquo;s
clay, a type, a token.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen many young men, and none like unto
him.&nbsp; He is shallow but clear; he is simple, but
ingenuous.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drag the ford again, then.&nbsp; In my mind he is as
deep as the big tankard; and a mouthful of rough burrage will be
the beginning and end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear of that.&nbsp; Neither, if rightly reported by
the youngster, is there so much doctrine in the doctor as we
expected.&nbsp; He doth not dwell upon the main; he is worldly;
he is wise in his generation,&mdash;he says things out of his own
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas, that can&rsquo;t hold!&nbsp; We want
<i>props&mdash;fulcrums</i>, I think you called &rsquo;em to the
farmers; or was it <i>stimulums</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both very good words.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be mightily pleased to hear thee dispute with
that great don.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate disputations.&nbsp; Saint Paul warns us against
them.&nbsp; If one wants to be thirsty, the tail of a stockfish
is as good for it as the head of a logician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor there, at Oxford, is in flesh and mettle;
but let him be sleek and gingered as he may, clap me in St.
Mary&rsquo;s pulpit, cassock me, lamb-skin me, give me pink for
my colours, glove me to the elbow, heel-piece me half an ell
high, cushion me before and behind, bring me a mug of mild ale
and a rasher of bacon, only just to con over the text withal;
then allow me fair play, and as much of my own way as he had, and
the devil take the hindermost.&nbsp; I am his man at any
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am fain to believe it.&nbsp; Verily, I do think,
Silas, thou hast as much stuff in thee as most men.&nbsp; Our
beef and mutton at Charlecote rear other than babes and
sucklings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like words taken, like thine, from black-letter
books.&nbsp; They look stiff and sterling, and as though a man
might dig about &rsquo;em for a week, and never loosen the
lightest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast alway at hand either saint or devil, as
occasion needeth, according to the quality of the sinner, and
they never come uncalled for.&nbsp; Moreover, Master Silas, I
have observed that thy hell-fire is generally lighted up in the
pulpit about the dog-days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turned the worthy knight unto the youth,
saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T were well for thee, William Shakspeare, if the
learned doctor had kept thee longer in his house, and had shewn
unto thee the danger of idleness, which hath often led unto
deer-stealing and poetry.&nbsp; In thee we already know the one,
although the distemper hath eaten but skin-deep for the present;
and we have the testimony of two burgesses on the other.&nbsp;
The pursuit of poetry, as likewise of game, is unforbidden to
persons of condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, that of game is the more likely to keep them in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the more knightly of the two; but poetry hath
also her pursuers among us.&nbsp; I myself, in my youth, had some
experience that way; and I am fain to blush at the reputation I
obtained.&nbsp; His honour, my father, took me to London at the
age of twenty; and, sparing no expense in my education, gave
fifty shillings to one Monsieur Dubois to teach me fencing and
poetry, in twenty lessons.&nbsp; In vacant hours he taught us
also the laws of honour, which are different from ours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In France you are unpolite unless you solicit a judge
or his wife to favour your cause; and you inevitably lose
it.&nbsp; In France there is no want of honour where there is no
want of courage; you may lie, but you must not hear that you
lie.&nbsp; I asked him what he thought then of lying; and he
replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>C&rsquo;est selon</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And suppose you should overhear the
whisper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Ah</i>, <i>parbleu</i>!&nbsp; <i>Cela
m&rsquo;irrite</i>; <i>cela me pousse au bout</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going on to remark that a real man of honour
could less bear to lie than to hear it; when he cried, at the
words <i>real man of honour</i>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Le voil&agrave;</i>, <i>Monsieur</i>! <i>le
voil&agrave;</i>!&rsquo; and gave himself such a blow on the
breast as convinced me the French are a brave people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told us that nothing but his honour was left him,
but that it supplied the place of all he had lost.&nbsp; It was
discovered some time afterward that M. Dubois had been guilty of
perjury, had been a spy, and had lost nothing but a dozen or two
of tin patty-pans, hereditary in his family, his father having
been a cook on his own account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;William, it is well at thy time of life that thou
shouldst know the customs of far countries, particularly if it
should be the will of God to place thee in a company of
players.&nbsp; Of all nations in the world, the French best
understand the stage.&nbsp; If thou shouldst ever write for it,
which God forbid, copy them very carefully.&nbsp; Murders on
their stage are quite decorous and cleanly.&nbsp; Few gentlemen
and ladies die by violence who would not have died by
exhaustion.&nbsp; &lsquo;For they rant and rave until their voice
fails them, one after another; and those who do not die of it die
consumptive.&nbsp; They cannot bear to see cruelty; they would
rather see any image than their own.&rsquo;&nbsp; These are not
my observations, but were made by Sir Everard Starkeye, who
likewise did remark to Monsieur Dubois, that &lsquo;cats, if you
hold them up to the looking-glass, will scratch you terribly; and
that the same fierce animal, as if proud of its cleanly coat and
velvety paw, doth carefully put aside what other animals of more
estimation take no trouble to conceal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Our people,&rsquo; said Sir Everard, &lsquo;must
see upon the stage what they never could have imagined; so the
best men in the world would earnestly take a peep of hell through
a chink, whereas the worser would skulk away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not thou be their caterer, William!&nbsp; Avoid the
writing of comedies and tragedies.&nbsp; To make people laugh is
uncivil, and to make people cry is unkind.&nbsp; And what, after
all, are these comedies and these tragedies?&nbsp; They are what,
for the benefit of all future generations, I have myself
described them,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The whimsies of wantons and stories of
dread,<br />
That make the stout-hearted look under the bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, let me warn thee against the same on account of
the vast charges thou must stand at.&nbsp; We Englishmen cannot
find it in our hearts to murder a man without much difficulty,
hesitation, and delay.&nbsp; We have little or no invention for
pains and penalties; it is only our acutest lawyers who have wit
enough to frame them.&nbsp; Therefore it behooveth your
tragedy-man to provide a rich assortment of them, in order to
strike the auditor with awe and wonder.&nbsp; And a tragedy-man,
in our country, who cannot afford a fair dozen of stabbed males,
and a trifle under that mark of poisoned females, and chains enow
to moor a whole navy in dock, is but a scurvy fellow at the
best.&nbsp; Thou wilt find trouble in purveying these
necessaries; and then must come the gim-cracks for the second
course,&mdash;gods, goddesses, fates, furies, battles, marriages,
music, and the maypole.&nbsp; Hast thou within thee
wherewithal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; replied Billy, with great modesty, &ldquo;I
am most grateful for these ripe fruits of your experience.&nbsp;
To admit delightful visions into my own twilight chamber is not
dangerous nor forbidden.&nbsp; Believe me, sir, he who indulges
in them will abstain from injuring his neighbour; he will see no
glory in peril, and no delight in strife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world shall never be troubled by any battles and
marriages of mine, and I desire no other music and no other
maypole than have lightened my heart at Stratford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, finding him well-conditioned and manageable,
proceeded:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although I have admonished thee of sundry and
insurmountable impediments, yet more are lying in the
pathway.&nbsp; We have no verse for tragedy.&nbsp; One in his
hurry hath dropped rhyme, and walketh like unto the man who
wanteth the left-leg stocking.&nbsp; Others can give us rhyme
indeed, but can hold no longer after the tenth or eleventh
syllable.&nbsp; Now Sir Everard Starkeye, who is a pretty poet,
did confess to Monsieur Dubois the potency of the French tragic
verse, which thou never canst hope to bring over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wonder, Monsieur Dubois!&rsquo; said Sir
Everard, &lsquo;that your countrymen should have thought it
necessary to transport their heavy artillery into Italy.&nbsp; No
Italian could stand a volley of your heroic verses from the best
and biggest pieces.&nbsp; With these brought into action, you
never could have lost the battle of Pavia.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now my friend Sir Everard is not quite so good a
historian as he is a poet; and Monsieur Dubois took advantage of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pardon!&nbsp; Monsieur Sir Everard!&rsquo; said
Monsieur Dubois, smiling at my friend&rsquo;s slip, &lsquo;We did
not lose the battle of Pavia.&nbsp; We had the misfortune to lose
our king, who delivered himself up, as our kings always do, for
the good and glory of his country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How was this?&rsquo; said Sir Everard, in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will tell you, Monsieur Sir Everard!&rsquo;
said Monsieur Dubois.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had it from my own father,
who fought in the battle, and told my mother, word for word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The king seeing his household troops, being only
one thousand strong, surrounded by twelve regiments, the best
Spanish troops, amounting to eighteen thousand four hundred and
forty-two, although he doubted not of victory, yet thought he
might lose many brave men before the close of the day, and rode
up instantly to King Charles, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;My brother!&nbsp; I am loath to lose so
many of those brave men yonder.&nbsp; Whistle off your Spanish
pointers, and I agree to ride home with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And so he did.&nbsp; But what did King
Charles?&nbsp; Abusing French loyalty, he made our Francis his
prisoner, would you believe it? and treated him worse than ever
badger was treated at the bottom of any paltry stable-yard,
putting upon his table beer and Rhenish wine and wild
boar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have digressed with thee, young man,&rdquo; continued
the knight, much to the improvement of my knowledge, I do
reverentially confess, as it was of the lad&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We will now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;endeavour our best to
sober thee, finding that Doctor Glaston hath omitted
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely omitted it,&rdquo; said William,
gratefully; &ldquo;he did after dinner all that could be done at
such a time toward it.&nbsp; The doctor could, however, speak
only of the Greeks and Romans, and certainly what he said of them
gave me but little encouragement.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What said he?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;The Greeks conveyed all their wisdom
into their theatre,&mdash;their stages were churches and
parliament-houses; but what was false prevailed over what was
true.&nbsp; They had their own wisdom, the wisdom of the
foolish.&nbsp; Who is Sophocles, if compared to Doctor Hammersley
of Oriel? or Euripides, if compared to Doctor Prichard of
Jesus?&nbsp; Without the Gospel, light is darkness; and with it,
children are giants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;William, I need not expatiate on Greek with
thee, since thou knowest it not, but some crumbs of Latin are
picked up by the callowest beaks.&nbsp; The Romans had, as thou
findest, and have still, more taste for murder than morality,
and, as they could not find heroes among them, looked for
gladiators.&nbsp; Their only very high poet employed his
elevation and strength to dethrone and debase the Deity.&nbsp;
They had several others, who polished their language and pitched
their instruments with admirable skill; several who glued over
their thin and flimsy gaberdines many bright feathers from the
widespread downs of Ionia, and the richly cultivated rocks of
Attica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some of them have spoken from inspiration; for
thou art not to suppose that from the heathen were withheld all
the manifestations of the Lord.&nbsp; We do agree at Oxford that
the Pollio of Virgil is our Saviour.&nbsp; True, it is the
dullest and poorest poem that a nation not very poetical hath
bequeathed unto us; and even the versification, in which this
master excelled, is wanting in fluency and sweetness.&nbsp; I can
only account for it from the weight of the subject.&nbsp; Two
verses, which are fairly worth two hundred such poems, are from
another pagan; he was forced to sigh for the church without
knowing her.&nbsp; He saith,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;May I gaze upon thee when my latest hour
is come!<br />
May I hold thy hand when mine faileth me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, if adumbrating the church, is the most beautiful thought
that ever issued from the heart of man; but if addressed to a
wanton, as some do opine, is filth from the sink, nauseating and
insufferable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;William! that which moveth the heart most is the
best poetry; it comes nearest unto God, the source of all
power.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea; and he appeareth unto me to know more of poetry
than of divinity.&nbsp; Those ancients have little flesh upon the
body poetical, and lack the savour that sufficeth.&nbsp; The Song
of Solomon drowns all their voices: they seem but whistlers and
guitar-players compared to a full-cheeked trumpeter; they
standing under the eaves in some dark lane, he upon a
well-caparisoned stallion, tossing his mane and all his ribbons
to the sun.&nbsp; I doubt the doctor spake too fondly of the
Greeks; they were giddy creatures.&nbsp; William, I am loath to
be hard on them; but they please me not.&nbsp; There are those
now living who could make them bite their nails to the quick, and
turn green as grass with envy.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, one of those Greeks, methinks, thrown into the
pickle-pot, would be a treasure to the housewife&rsquo;s young
jerkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simpleton! simpleton! but thou valuest them
justly.&nbsp; Now attend.&nbsp; If ever thou shouldst hear, at
Oxford or London, the verses I am about to repeat, prithee do not
communicate them to that fiery spirit Mat Atterend.&nbsp; It
might not be the battle of two hundreds, but two counties; a sort
of York and Lancaster war, whereof I would wash my hands.&nbsp;
Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now did Sir Thomas clear his voice, always high and
sonorous, and did repeat from the stores of his memory these rich
and proud verses,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Chloe! mean men must ever make
mean loves;<br />
They deal in dog-roses, but I in cloves.<br />
They are just scorch&rsquo;d enough to blow their fingers;<br />
I am a ph&oelig;nix downright burnt to cinders.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At which noble conceits, so far above what poor Bill had ever
imagined, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and
exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world itself must be reduced to that condition
before such glorious verses die!&nbsp; <i>Chloe</i> and
<i>Clove</i>!&nbsp; Why, sir! Chloe wants but a V toward the tail
to become the very thing!&nbsp; Never tell me that such matters
can come about of themselves.&nbsp; And how truly is it said that
we mean men deal in dog-roses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, if it were permitted me to swear on that holy
Bible, I would swear I never until this day heard that dog-roses
were our provender; and yet did I, no longer ago than last
summer, write, not indeed upon a dog-rose, but upon a
sweet-briar, what would only serve to rinse the mouth withal
after the clove.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repeat the same, youth.&nbsp; We may haply give thee
our counsel thereupon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willy took heart, and lowering his voice, which hath much
natural mellowness, repeated these from memory:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My briar that
smelledst sweet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When gentle spring&rsquo;s first heat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ran through thy quiet
veins,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou that wouldst injure none,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But wouldst be left alone,&mdash;<br />
Alone thou leavest me, and nought of thine remains.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What! hath no
poet&rsquo;s lyre<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er thee, sweet-breathing briar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hung fondly, ill or well?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet methinks with thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A poet&rsquo;s sympathy,<br />
Whether in weal or woe, in life or death, might dwell.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hard usage both must
bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Few hands your youth will rear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few bosoms cherish you;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your tender prime must bleed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere you are sweet, but freed<br />
From life, you then are prized; thus prized are poets
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas said, with kind encouragement, &ldquo;He who
beginneth so discreetly with a dog-rose, may hope to encompass a
damask-rose ere he die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willy did now breathe freely.&nbsp; The commendation of a
knight and magistrate worked powerfully within him; and Sir
Thomas said furthermore,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These short matters do not suit me.&nbsp; Thou mightest
have added some moral about life and beauty,&mdash;poets never
handle roses without one; but thou art young, and mayest get into
the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willy made the best excuse he could; and no bad one it was,
the knight acknowledged; namely, that the sweet-briar was not
really dead, although left for dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, &ldquo;as life and beauty
would not serve thy turn, thou mightest have had full enjoyment
of the beggar, the wayside, the thieves, and the good
Samaritan,&mdash;enough to tapestry the bridal chamber of an
empress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William bowed respectfully, and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! thou hast lost them, sure enough, and it may not be
quite so fair to smile at thy quandary,&rdquo; quoth Sir
Thomas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did my best the first time,&rdquo; said Willy,
&ldquo;and fell short the second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, indeed, thou must have done,&rdquo; said Sir
Thomas.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a grievous disappointment, in the
midst of our lamentations for the dead, to find ourselves
balked.&nbsp; I am curious to see how thou couldst help
thyself.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be abashed; I am ready for even worse
than the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill hesitated, but obeyed:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And art thou yet
alive?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shall the happy hive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Send out her youth to cull<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy sweets of leaf and flower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And spend the sunny hour<br />
With thee, and thy faint heart with murmuring music lull?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me what tender
care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me what pious prayer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bade thee arise and live.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fondest-favoured bee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall whisper nought to thee<br />
More loving than the song my grateful muse shall give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas looked somewhat less pleased at the conclusion of
these verses than at the conclusion of the former, and said,
gravely,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man! methinks it is betimes that thou talkest of
having a muse to thyself; or even in common with others.&nbsp; It
is only great poets who have muses; I mean to say who have the
right to talk in that fashion.&nbsp; The French, I hear,
<i>Ph&oelig;bus</i> it and <i>muse-me</i> it right and left; and
boggle not to throw all nine, together with mother and master,
into the compass of a dozen lines or thereabout.&nbsp; And your
Italian can hardly do without &rsquo;em in the
multiplication-table.&nbsp; We Englishmen do let them in quietly,
shut the door, and say nothing of what passes.&nbsp; I have read
a whole book of comedies, and ne&rsquo;er a muse to help the
lamest.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful forbearance!&nbsp; I marvel how the poet
could get through.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God&rsquo;s help.&nbsp; And I think we did as well
without &rsquo;em; for it must be an unabashable man that ever
shook his sides in their company.&nbsp; They lay heavy restraint
both upon laughing and crying.&nbsp; In the great master Virgil
of Rome, they tell me they come in to count the ships, and having
cast up the sum total, and proved it, make off again.&nbsp; Sure
token of two things,&mdash;first, that he held &rsquo;em
dog-cheap; secondly, that he had made but little progress (for a
Lombard born) in book-keeping at double entry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He, and every other great genius, began with small
subject-matters, gnats and the like.&nbsp; I myself, similar unto
him, wrote upon fruit.&nbsp; I would give thee some copies for
thy copying, if I thought thou wouldst use them temperately, and
not render them common, as hath befallen the poetry of some among
the brightest geniuses.&nbsp; I could shew thee how to say new
things, and how to time the same.&nbsp; Before my day, nearly all
the flowers and fruits had been gathered by poets, old and young,
<i>from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop on the wall</i>; roses
went up to Solomon, apples to Adam, and so forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willy! my brave lad!&nbsp; I was the first that ever
handled a quince, I&rsquo;ll be sworn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearken!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Chloe!&nbsp; I would not have thee
wince<br />
That I unto thee send a quince.<br />
I would not have thee say unto &rsquo;t<br />
<i>Begone</i>! and trample &rsquo;t underfoot,<br />
For, trust me, &rsquo;t is no fulsome fruit.<br />
It came not out of mine own garden,<br />
But all the way from Henly in Arden,&mdash;<br />
Of an uncommon fine old tree,<br />
Belonging to John Asbury.<br />
And if that of it thou shalt eat,<br />
&rsquo;Twill make thy breath e&rsquo;en yet more sweet;<br />
As a translation here doth shew,<br />
<i>On fruit-trees</i>, <i>by Jean Mirabeau</i>.<br />
The frontispiece is printed so.<br />
But eat it with some wine and cake,<br />
Or it may give the belly-ache. <a name="citation153a"></a><a

This doth my worthy clerk indite,<br />
I sign,</p>
<p style="text-align: right" class="poetry"><span
class="smcap">Sir Thomas Lucy</span>, Knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Willy, there is not one poet or lover in twenty
who careth for consequences.&nbsp; Many hint to the lady what to
do, few what not to do although it would oftentimes, as in this
case, go to one&rsquo;s heart to see the upshot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir,&rdquo; said Bill, in all humility, &ldquo;I
would make bold to put the parings of that quince under my
pillow, for sweet dreams and insights, if Doctor Glaston had
given me encouragement to continue the pursuit of poetry.&nbsp;
Of a surety it would bless me with a bedful of churches and
crucifixions, duly adumbrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereat Sir Thomas, shaking his head, did inform
him,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in the golden age of the world, as pagans call
it, that poets of condition sent fruits and flowers to their
beloved, with posies fairly penned.&nbsp; We, in our days, have
done the like.&nbsp; But manners of late are much corrupted on
the one side, if not on both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willy! it hath been whispered that there be those who
would rather have a piece of brocade or velvet for a stomacher
than the touchingest copy of verses, with a bleeding heart at the
bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incredible!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T is even so!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must surely be rotten fragments of the world
before the flood,&mdash;saved out of it by the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not of that mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their eyes, mayhap, fell upon some of the bravery cast
ashore from the Spanish Armada.&nbsp; In ancienter days, a few
pages of good poetry outvalued a whole ell of the finest
Genoa.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will such days return?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only within these few years that corruption and
avarice have made such ghastly strides.&nbsp; They always did
exist, but were gentler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My youth is waning, and has been nigh upon these seven
years, I being now in my forty-eighth.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have understood that the god of poetry is in the
enjoyment of eternal youth; I was ignorant that his sons
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, child! we are hale and comely, but must go the way
of all flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must it, can it, be?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time was, my smallest gifts were acceptable, as thus
recorded:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;From my fair hand, O will ye, will ye<br
/>
Deign humbly to accept a gilly-<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flower for thy bosom, sugared maid!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Scarce had I said it ere she took it,<br
/>
And in a twinkling, faith! had stuck it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where e&rsquo;en proud knighthood might have
laid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William was now quite unable to contain himself, and seemed
utterly to have forgotten the grievous charge against him; to
such a pitch did his joy o&rsquo;erleap his jeopardy.</p>
<p>Master Silas in the meantime was much disquieted; and first
did he strip away all the white feather from every pen in the
inkpot, and then did he mend them, one and all, and then did he
slit them with his thumb-nail, and then did he pare and slash
away at them again and then did he cut off the tops, until at
last he left upon them neither nib nor plume, nor enough of the
middle to serve as quill to a virginal.&nbsp; It went to my heart
to see such a power of pens so wasted; there could not be fewer
than five.&nbsp; Sir Thomas was less wary than usual, being
overjoyed.&nbsp; For great poets do mightly affect to have little
poets under them; and little poets do forget themselves in great
company, as fiddlers do, who <i>hail fellow well met</i> even
with lords.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas did not interrupt our Bill&rsquo;s wild
gladness.&nbsp; I never thought so worshipful a personage could
bear so much.&nbsp; At last he said unto the lad,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do bethink me, if thou hearest much more of my
poetry, and the success attendant thereon, good Doctor Glaston
would tear thy skirt off ere he could drag thee back from the
occupation.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear me, for once, all his wisdom would sluice out in
vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was reported to me that when our virgin
queen&rsquo;s highness (her Dear Dread&rsquo;s <a
name="citation157a"></a><a href="#footnote157a"
class="citation">[157a]</a> ear not being then poisoned) heard
these verses, she said before her courtiers, to the sore travail
of some, and heart&rsquo;s content of others,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We need not envy our young cousin James of
Scotland his ass&rsquo;s bite of a thistle, having such flowers
as these gillyflowers on the chimney-stacks of
Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have told her highness that all this poetry,
from beginning to end, was real matter of fact, well and truly
spoken by mine own self.&nbsp; I had only to harness the rhymes
thereunto, at my leisure.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William

<p>&ldquo;None could ever doubt it.&nbsp; Greeks and Trojans may
fight for the quince; neither shall have it</p>
<p class="poetry">While a Warwickshire lad<br />

With a wand to wag<br />
On a trusty nag,<br />
He shall keep the lists<br />

Looks evil on Lucy.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, nay! do not trespass too soon upon
heroics.&nbsp; Thou seest thou canst not hold thy wind beyond
eight lines.&nbsp; What wouldst thou do under the heavy mettle
that should have wrought such wonders at Pavia, if thou findest
these petards so troublesome in discharging?&nbsp; Surely, the
good doctor, had he entered at large on the subject, would have
been very particular in urging this expostulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, to my mortification I must confess that I took to
myself the counsel he was giving to another; a young gentleman
who, from his pale face, his abstinence at table, his cough, his
taciturnity, and his gentleness, seemed already more than half
poet.&nbsp; To him did Doctor Glaston urge, with all his zeal and
judgment, many arguments against the vocation; telling him that,
even in college, he had few applauders, being the first, and not
the second or third, who always are more fortunate; reminding him
that he must solicit and obtain much interest with men of rank
and quality, before he could expect their favour; and that
without it the vein chilled, the nerve relaxed, and the poet was
left at next door to the bellman.&nbsp; &lsquo;In the coldness of
the world,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;in the absence of ready friends
and adherents, to light thee upstairs to the richly tapestried
chamber of the muses, thy spirits will abandon thee, thy heart
will sicken and swell within thee; overladen, thou wilt make, O
Ethelbert! a slow and painful progress, and ere the door open,
sink.&nbsp; Praise giveth weight unto the wanting, and happiness
giveth elasticity unto the heavy.&nbsp; As the mightiest streams
of the unexplored world, America, run languidly in the night, <a
name="citation159a"></a><a href="#footnote159a"
class="citation">[159a]</a> and await the sun on high to contend
with him in strength and grandeur, so doth genius halt and pause
in the thraldom of outspread darkness, and move onward with all
his vigour then only when creative light and jubilant warmth
surround him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethelbert coughed faintly; a tinge of red, the size of
a rose-bud, coloured the middle of his cheek; and yet he seemed
not to be pained by the reproof.&nbsp; He looked fondly and
affectionately at his teacher, who thus proceeded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear youth, do not carry the stone of
Sisyphus on thy shoulder to pave the way to disappointment.&nbsp;
If thou writest but indifferent poetry none will envy thee, and
some will praise thee; but nature, in her malignity, hath denied
unto thee a capacity for the enjoyment of such praise.&nbsp; In
this she hath been kinder to most others than to thee; we know
wherein she hath been kinder to thee than to most others.&nbsp;
If thou writest good poetry many will call it flat, many will
call it obscure, many will call it inharmonious; and some of
these will speak as they think; for, as in giving a feast to
great numbers, it is easier to possess the wine than to procure
the cups, so happens it in poetry; thou hast the beverage of thy
own growth, but canst not find the recipients.&nbsp; What is
simple and elegant to thee and me, to many an honest man is flat
and sterile; what to us is an innocently sly allusion, to as
worthy a one as either of us is dull obscurity; and that moreover
which swims upon our brain, and which throbs against our temples,
and which we delight in sounding to ourselves when the voice has
done with it, touches their ear, and awakens no harmony in any
cell of it.&nbsp; Rivals will run up to thee and call thee a
plagiary, and, rather than that proof should be wanting, similar
words to some of thine will be thrown in thy teeth out of
Leviticus and Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you desire calm studies?&nbsp; Do you desire
high thoughts?&nbsp; Penetrate into theology.&nbsp; What is
nobler than to dissect and discern the opinions of the gravest
men upon the subtlest matters?&nbsp; And what glorious victories
are those over Infidelity and Scepticism!&nbsp; How much loftier,
how much more lasting in their effects, than such as ye are
invited unto by what this ingenious youth hath contemptuously and
truly called</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The swaggering drum, and trumpet hoarse
with rage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what a delightful and edifying sight it is, to see
hundreds of the most able doctors, all stripped for the combat,
each closing with his antagonist, and tugging and tearing, tooth
and nail, to lay down and establish truths which have been
floating in the air for ages, and which the lower order of
mortals are forbidden to see, and commanded to embrace.&nbsp; And
then the shouts of victory!&nbsp; And then the crowns of amaranth
held over their heads by the applauding angels!&nbsp; Besides,
these combats have other great and distinct advantages.&nbsp;
Whereas, in the carnal, the longer ye contend the more blows do
ye receive; in these against Satan, the more fiercely and
pertinaciously ye drive at him, the slacker do ye find him; every
good hit makes him redden and rave with anger, but diminishes its
effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear friends, who would not enter a service
in which he may give blows to his mortal enemy, and receive none;
and in which not only the eternal gain is incalculable, but also
the temporal, at four-and-twenty, may be far above the emolument
of generals, who, before the priest was born, had bled profusely
for their country, established her security, brightened her
glory, and augmented her dominions?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this pause did Sir Thomas turn unto Sir Silas, and
asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sayest thou, Silas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon did Sir Silas make answer,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say it is so, and was so, and should be so, and shall
be so.&nbsp; If the queen&rsquo;s brother had not sopped the
priests and bishops out of the Catholic cup, they could have held
the Catholic cup in their own hands, instead of yielding it into
his.&nbsp; They earned their money; if they sold their
consciences for it, the business is theirs, not ours.&nbsp; I
call this facing the devil with a vengeance.&nbsp; We have their
coats; no matter who made &rsquo;em,&mdash;we have &rsquo;em, I
say, and we will wear &rsquo;em; and not a button, tag, or
tassel, shall any man tear away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas then turned to Willy, and requested him to proceed
with the doctor&rsquo;s discourse, who thereupon
continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Within your own recollections, how many good,
quiet, inoffensive men, unendowed with any extraordinary
abilities, have been enabled, by means of divinity, to enjoy a
long life in tranquillity and affluence?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereupon did one of the young gentlemen smile, and, on
small encouragement from Doctor Glaston to enounce the cause
thereof, he repeated these verses, which he gave afterward unto
me:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;In the names on
our books<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was standing Tom Flooke&rsquo;s,<br />
Who took in due time his degrees;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which when he had taken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Ascham or Bacon,<br />
By night he could snore and by day he could sneeze.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;Calm, pithy,
pragmatical, <a name="citation164a"></a><a href="#footnote164a"
class="citation">[164a]</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom Flooke he could at a call<br />
Rise up like a hound from his sleep;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And if many a quarto<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave not his heart to,<br />
If pellucid in lore, in his cups he was deep.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;He never did
harm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his heart might be warm,<br />
For his doublet most certainly was so;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now has Torn Flooke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A quieter nook<br />
Than ever had Spenser or Tasso.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;He lives in his
house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As still as a mouse,<br />
Until he has eaten his dinner;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But then doth his nose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Outroar all the woes<br />
That encompass the death of a sinner.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;And there oft
has been seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No less than a dean<br />
To tarry a week in the parish,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In October and March,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When deans are less starch,<br />
And days are less gleamy and garish.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;That Sunday
Tom&rsquo;s eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look&rsquo;d always more wise,<br />
He repeated more often his text;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two leaves stuck together,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (The fault of the weather)<br />
And . . . <i>the rest ye shall hear in my next</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;At mess he lost
quite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His small appetite,<br />
By losing his friend the good dean;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cook&rsquo;s sight must fail her!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The eggs sure are staler!<br />
The beef, too!&mdash;why, what can it mean?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;He turned off
the butcher,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the cook could he clutch her,<br />
What his choler had done there&rsquo;s no saying&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;T is verily said<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He smote low the cock&rsquo;s head,<br />
And took other pullets for laying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this being concluded, Doctor Glaston said he
shrewdly suspected an indigestion on the part of Mr. Thomas
Flooke, caused by sitting up late and studying hard with Mr.
Dean; and he protested that theology itself should not carry us
into the rawness of the morning air, particularly in such
critical months as March and October, in one of which the sap
rises, in the other sinks, and there are many stars very
sinister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas shook his head, and declared he would not be
uncharitable to rector, or dean, or doctor, but that certain
surmises swam uppermost.&nbsp; He then winked at Master Silas,
who said, incontinently,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have it, Sir Thomas!&nbsp; The blind buzzards! with
their stars and saps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but Silas! you yourself have told us over and
over again, in church, that there are <i>arcana</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there are,&mdash;I uphold it,&rdquo; replied Master
Silas; &ldquo;but a fig for the greater part, and a fig-leaf for
the rest.&nbsp; As for these signs, they are as plain as any page
in the Revelation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, after short pondering, said,
scoffingly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In regard to the rawness of the air having any effect
whatsoever on those who discourse orthodoxically on theology, it
is quite as absurd as to imagine that a man ever caught cold in a
Protestant church.&nbsp; I am rather of opinion that it was a
judgment on the rector for his evil-mindedness toward the cook,
the Lord foreknowing that he was about to be wilful and vengeful
in that quarter.&nbsp; It was, however, more advisedly that he
took other pullets, on his own view of the case, although it
might be that the same pullets would suit him again as well as
ever, when his appetite should return; for it doth not appear
that they were loath to lay, but laid somewhat
unsatisfactorily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, youth,&rdquo; continued his worship, &ldquo;if in
our clemency we should spare thy life, study this higher
elegiacal strain which thou hast carried with thee from Oxford;
it containeth, over and above an unusual store of biography, much
sound moral doctrine, for those who are heedful in the weighing
of it.&nbsp; And what can be more affecting than&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;At mess he lost
quite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His small appetite,<br />
By losing his friend the good dean&rsquo;?</p>
<p>And what an insight into character!&nbsp; Store it up; store
it up!&nbsp; <i>Small appetite</i>, particular; <i>good dean</i>,
generick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hereupon did Master Silas jerk me with his indicative joint,
the elbow to wit, and did say in my ear,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means <i>deanery</i>.&nbsp; Give me one of those
bones so full of marrow, and let my lord bishop have all the meat
over it, and welcome.&nbsp; If a dean is not on his stilts, he is
not on his stumps; he stands on his own ground; he is a
<i>noli-metangeretarian</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What art thou saying of those sectaries, good Master
Silas?&rdquo; quoth Sir Thomas, not hearing him distinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was talking of the dean,&rdquo; replied Master
Silas.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was the very dean who wrote and sang that
song called the <i>Two Jacks</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast it?&rdquo; asked he.</p>
<p>Master Silas shook his head, and, trying in vain to recollect
it, said at last,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After dinner it sometimes pops out of a filbert-shell
in a crack; and I have known it float on the first glass of
Herefordshire cider; it also hath some affinity with very stiff
and old bottled beer; but in a morning it seemeth unto me like a
remnant of over-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our memory waneth, Master Silas!&rdquo; quoth Sir
Thomas, looking seriously.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thou couldst repeat
it, without the grimace of singing, it were not ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Silas struck the table with his fist, and repeated the
first stave angrily; but in the second he forgot the admonition
of Sir Thomas, and did sing outright,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jack Calvin and Jack
Cade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two gentles of one trade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two tinkers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Very gladly would pull down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother Church and Father Crown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And would starve or would drown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right thinkers.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Honest man! honest
man!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fill the can, fill the can,<br />
They are coming! they are coming! they are coming!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If any drop be left,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It might tempt &rsquo;em to a theft&mdash;<br />
Zooks! it was only the ale that was humming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first stave, gramercy! there is an awful
verity,&rdquo; quoth Sir Thomas; &ldquo;but I wonder that a dean
should let his skewer slip out, and his fat catch fire so
wofully, in the second.&nbsp; Light stuff, Silas, fit only for
ale-houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Silas was nettled in the nose, and answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see the man in Warwickshire, and in all the
counties round, who can run at such a rate with so light a
feather in the palm of his hand.&nbsp; I am no poet, thank God!
but I know what folks can do, and what folks cannot
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Silas,&rdquo; replied Sir Thomas, &ldquo;after
thy thanksgiving for being no poet, let us have the rest of the
piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest!&rdquo; quoth Master Silas.&nbsp; &ldquo;When
the ale hath done with its humming, it is time, methinks, to
dismiss it.&nbsp; Sir, there never was any more; you might as
well ask for more after Amen or the see of Canterbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas was dissatisfied, and turned off the discourse; and
peradventure he grew more inclined to be gracious unto Willy from
the slight rub his chaplain had given him, were it only for the
contrariety.&nbsp; When he had collected his thoughts he was
determined to assert his supremacy on the score of poetry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deans, I perceive, like other quality,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;cannot run on long together.&nbsp; My friend, Sir Everard
Starkeye, could never overleap four bars.&nbsp; I remember but
one composition of his, on a young lady who mocked at his
inconsistency, in calling her sometimes his Grace and at other
times his Muse.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;My Grace shall Fanny Carew be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While here she deigns to stay;<br />
And (ah, how sad the change for me!)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Muse when far away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And when we laughed at him for turning his back upon her after
the fourth verse, all he could say for himself was, that he would
rather a game at <i>all fours</i> with Fanny, than <i>ombre</i>
and <i>picquet</i> with the finest furbelows in
Christendom.&nbsp; Men of condition do usually want a belt in the
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereunto said Master Silas,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men out of condition are quite as liable to lack it,
methinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas!&nbsp; Silas!&rdquo; replied the knight,
impatiently, &ldquo;prithee keep to thy divinity, thy strong hold
upon Zion; thence none that faces thee can draw thee without
being bitten to the bone.&nbsp; Leave poetry to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; quoth Master Silas, &ldquo;I
will never ask a belt from her, until I see she can afford to
give a shirt.&nbsp; She has promised a belt, indeed,&mdash;not
one, however, that doth much improve the wind,&mdash;to this lad
here, and will keep her word; but she was forced to borrow the
pattern from a Carthusian friar, and somehow it slips above the
shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am by no means sure of that,&rdquo; quoth Sir
Thomas.&nbsp; &ldquo;He shall have fair play.&nbsp; He carrieth
in his mind many valuable things, whereof it hath pleased
Providence to ordain him the depository.&nbsp; He hath laid
before us certain sprigs of poetry from Oxford, trim as
pennyroyal, and larger leaves of household divinity, the most
mildly-savoured,&mdash;pleasant in health and wholesome in
sickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I relish not such mutton-broth divinity,&rdquo; said
Master Silas.&nbsp; &ldquo;It makes me sick in order to settle my
stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may improve it,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;but
first let us hear more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then did William Shakspeare resume Dr. Glaston&rsquo;s
discourse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ethelbert!&nbsp; I think thou walkest but
little; otherwise I should take thee with me, some fine fresh
morning, as far as unto the first hamlet on the Cherwell.&nbsp;
There lies young Wellerby, who, the year before, was wont to pass
many hours of the day poetising amid the ruins of Godstow
nunnery.&nbsp; It is said that he bore a fondness toward a young
maiden in that place, formerly a village, now containing but two
old farm-houses.&nbsp; In my memory there were still extant
several dormitories.&nbsp; Some love-sick girl had recollected an
ancient name, and had engraven on a stone with a garden-nail,
which lay in rust near it,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">&ldquo;POORE ROSAMUND.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I entered these precincts, and beheld a youth of manly form
and countenance, washing and wiping a stone with a handful of wet
grass; and on my going up to him, and asking what he had found,
he shewed it to me.&nbsp; The next time I saw him was near the
banks of the Cherwell.&nbsp; He had tried, it appears, to forget
or overcome his foolish passion, and had applied his whole mind
unto study.&nbsp; He was foiled by his competitor; and now he
sought consolation in poetry.&nbsp; Whether this opened the
wounds that had closed in his youthful breast, and malignant
Love, in his revenge, poisoned it; or whether the disappointment
he had experienced in finding others preferred to him, first in
the paths of fortune, then in those of the muses,&mdash;he was
thought to have died broken-hearted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;About half a mile from St. John&rsquo;s College
is the termination of a natural terrace, with the Cherwell close
under it, in some places bright with yellow and red flowers
glancing and glowing through the stream, and suddenly in others
dark with the shadows of many different trees, in broad,
overbending thickets, and with rushes spear-high, and
party-coloured flags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After a walk in Midsummer, the emersion of our
hands into the cool and closing grass is surely not the least
among our animal delights.&nbsp; I was just seated, and the first
sensation of rest vibrated in me gently, as though it were music
to the limbs, when I discovered by a hollow in the herbage that
another was near.&nbsp; The long meadow-sweet and blooming burnet
half concealed from me him whom the earth was about to hide
totally and for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Master Batchelor,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it is
ill-sleeping by the water-side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No answer was returned.&nbsp; I arose, went to
the place, and recognised poor Wellerby.&nbsp; His brow was
moist, his cheek was warm.&nbsp; A few moments earlier, and that
dismal lake whereunto and wherefrom the waters of life, the
buoyant blood, ran no longer, might have received one vivifying
ray reflected from my poor casement.&nbsp; I might not indeed
have comforted&mdash;I have often failed; but there is one who
never has; and the strengthener of the bruised reed should have
been with us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Remembering that his mother did abide one mile
further on, I walked forward to the mansion, and asked her what
tidings she lately had received of her son.&nbsp; She replied
that, having given up his mind to light studies, the fellows of
the college would not elect him.&nbsp; The master had warned him
beforehand to abandon his selfish poetry, take up manfully the
quarterstaff of logic, and wield it for St. John&rsquo;s, come
who would into the ring.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;We want our
man,&rsquo;&rdquo; said he to me, &ldquo;&lsquo;and your son hath
failed us in the hour of need.&nbsp; Madam, he hath been foully
beaten in the schools by one he might have swallowed, with due
exercise.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;I rated him, told him I was poor, and he
knew it.&nbsp; He was stung, and threw himself upon my neck, and
wept.&nbsp; Twelve days have passed since, and only three rainy
ones.&nbsp; I hear he has been seen upon the knoll yonder; but
hither he hath not come.&nbsp; I trust he knows at last the value
of time, and I shall be heartily glad to see him after this
accession of knowledge.&nbsp; Twelve days, it is true, are rather
a chink than a gap in time; yet, O gentle sir, they are that
chink which makes the vase quite valueless.&nbsp; There are light
words which may never be shaken off the mind they fall on.&nbsp;
My child, who was hurt by me, will not let me see the
marks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;none are left
upon him.&nbsp; Be comforted! thou shalt see him this hour.&nbsp;
All that thy God hath not taken is yet thine.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
looked at me earnestly, and would have then asked something, but
her voice failed her.&nbsp; There was no agony, no motion, save
in the lips and cheeks.&nbsp; Being the widow of one who fought
under Hawkins, she remembered his courage and sustained the
shock, saying calmly, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done!&nbsp; I
pray that he find me as worthy as he findeth me willing to join
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, in her unearthly thoughts she had led her
only son to the bosom of her husband; and in her spirit (which
often is permitted to pass the gates of death with holy love) she
left them both with their Creator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The curate of the village sent those who should
bring home the body; and some days afterward he came unto me,
beseeching me to write the epitaph.&nbsp; Being no friend to
stonecutters&rsquo; charges, I entered not into biography, but
wrote these few words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">JOANNES WELLERBY,<br />
LITERARUM QU&AElig;SIVIT GLORIAM,<br />
VIDET DEI.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Poor tack! poor tack!&rdquo; sourly quoth Master
Silas.&nbsp; &ldquo;If your wise doctor could say nothing more
about the fool, who died like a rotten sheep among the darnels,
his Latin might have held out for the father, and might have told
people he was as cool as a cucumber at home, and as hot as pepper
in battle.&nbsp; Could he not find room enough on the whinstone,
to tell the folks of the village how he played the devil among
the dons, burning their fingers when they would put thumbscrews
upon us, punching them in the weasand as a blacksmith punches a
horse-shoe, and throwing them overboard like bilgewater?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Oxford lost all her Latin?&nbsp; Here is no
<i>capitani filius</i>; no more mention of family than a Welchman
would have allowed him; no <i>h&icirc;c jacet</i>; and, worse
than all, the devil a tittle of <i>spe redemptionis</i>, or
<i>anno Domini</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willy!&rdquo; quoth Sir Thomas, &ldquo;I shrewdly do
suspect there was more, and that thou hast forgotten
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; answered Willy, &ldquo;I wrote not down the
words, fearing to mis-spell them, and begged them of the doctor,
when I took my leave of him on the morrow; and verily he wrote
down all he had repeated.&nbsp; I keep them always in the tin-box
in my waistcoat-pocket, among the eel-hooks, on a scrap of paper
a finger&rsquo;s length and breadth, folded in the middle to
fit.&nbsp; And when the eels are running, I often take it out and
read it before I am aware.&nbsp; I could as soon forget my own
epitaph as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simpleton!&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, with his gentle,
compassionate smile; &ldquo;but thou hast cleared
thyself.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the doctor gave one idle chap as much solid
pudding as he could digest, with a slice to spare for
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet after this pudding the doctor gave him a
spoonful of custard, flavoured with a little bitter, which was
mostly left at the bottom for the other idle chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas not only did endure this very goodnaturedly, but
deigned even to take in good part the smile upon my countenance,
as though he were a smile collector, and as though his estate
were so humble that he could hold his laced bonnet (in all his
bravery) for bear and fiddle.</p>
<p>He then said unto Willy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Place likewise this custard before us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is but little of it; the platter is
shallow,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;&rsquo;t was suited to Master
Ethelbert&rsquo;s appetite.&nbsp; The contents were these:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The things whereon thy whole soul brooded in its
innermost recesses, and with all its warmth and energy, will pass
unprized and unregarded, not only throughout thy lifetime but
long after.&nbsp; For the higher beauties of poetry are beyond
the capacity, beyond the vision of almost all.&nbsp; Once perhaps
in half a century a single star is discovered, then named and
registered, then mentioned by five studious men to five more; at
last some twenty say, or repeat in writing, what they have heard
about it.&nbsp; Other stars await other discoveries.&nbsp; Few
and solitary and wide asunder are those who calculate their
relative distances, their mysterious influences, their glorious
magnitude, and their stupendous height.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is so,
believe me, and ever was so, with the truest and best
poetry.&nbsp; Homer, they say, was blind; he might have been ere
he died,&mdash;that he sat among the blind, we are sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Happy they who, like this young lad from
Stratford, write poetry on the saddle-bow when their geldings are
jaded, and keep the desk for better purposes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young gentlemen, like the elderly, all turned their
faces toward me, to my confusion, so much did I remark of sneer
and scoff at my cost.&nbsp; Master Ethelbert was the only one who
spared me.&nbsp; He smiled and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be patient!&nbsp; From the higher heavens of
poetry, it is long before the radiance of the brightest star can
reach the world below.&nbsp; We hear that one man finds out one
beauty, another man finds out another, placing his observatory
and instruments on the poet&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; The worms must
have eaten us before it is rightly known what we are.&nbsp; It is
only when we are skeletons that we are boxed and ticketed, and
prized and shewn.&nbsp; Be it so!&nbsp; I shall not be tired of
waiting.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reasonable youth!&rdquo; said Sir Thomas; &ldquo;yet
both he and Glaston walk rather <i>a-straddle</i>,
methinks.&nbsp; They might have stepped up to thee more
straightforwardly, and told thee the trade ill suiteth thee,
having little fire, little fantasy, and little learning.&nbsp;
Furthermore, that one poet, as one bull, sufficeth for two
parishes, and that where they are stuck too close together they
are apt to fire, like haystacks.&nbsp; I have known it myself; I
have had my malignants and scoffers.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William

<p>&ldquo;I never could have thought it!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There again!&nbsp; Another proof of thy
inexperience.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William

<p>&ldquo;Mat Atterend!&nbsp; Mat Atterend! where wert thou
sleeping?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir

<p>&ldquo;I shall now from my own stores impart unto thee what
will avail to tame thee, shewing the utter hopelessness of
standing on that golden weathercock which supporteth but one at a
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The passion for poetry wherewith Monsieur Dubois would
have inspired me, as he was bound to do, being paid beforehand,
had cold water thrown upon it by that unlucky one, Sir
Everard.&nbsp; He ridiculed the idea of male and female rhymes,
and the necessity of trying them as rigidly by the eye as by the
ear,&mdash;saying to Monsieur Dubois that the palate, in which
the French excel all mortals, ought also to be consulted in their
acceptance or rejection.&nbsp; Monsieur Dubois told us that if we
did not wish to be taught French verse, he would teach us
English.&nbsp; Sir Everard preferred the Greek; but Monsieur
Dubois would not engage to teach the mysteries of that poetry in
fewer than thirty lessons,&mdash;having (since his misfortunes)
forgotten the letters and some other necessaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first poem I ever wrote was in the character of a
shepherd, to Mistress Anne Nanfan, daughter of Squire Fulke
Nanfan, of Worcestershire, at that time on a visit to the
worshipful family of Compton at Long Compton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were young creatures,&mdash;I but twenty-four and
seven months (for it was written on the 14th of May), and she
well-nigh upon a twelve-month younger.&nbsp; My own verses, the
first, are neither here nor there; indeed, they were imbedded in
solid prose, like lampreys and ram&rsquo;s-horns <a
name="citation181a"></a><a href="#footnote181a"
class="citation">[181a]</a> in our limestone, and would be hard
to get out whole.&nbsp; What they are may be seen by her answer,
all in verse:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Faithful shepherd! dearest
Tommy!<br />
I have received the letter from ye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And mightily delight therein.<br />
But mother, <i>she</i> says, &ldquo;Nanny!&nbsp; Nanny!<br />
<i>How</i>, <i>being staid and prudent</i>, <i>can ye</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Think of a man and not of sin</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir shepherd!&nbsp; I held down
my head,<br />
And &ldquo;<i>Mother</i>! <i>fie</i>, <i>for shame</i>!&rdquo; I
said;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All I could say would not content her;<br />
Mother she would for ever harp on&rsquo;t,<br />
&ldquo;<i>A man&rsquo;s no better than a sarpent</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And not a crumb more
innocenter</i>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not how it happeneth; but a poet doth open
before a poet, albeit of baser sort.&nbsp; It is not that I hold
my poetry to be better than some other in time past, it is
because I would shew thee that I was virtuous and wooed
virtuously, that I repeat it.&nbsp; Furthermore, I wished to
leave a deep impression on the mother&rsquo;s mind that she was
exceedingly wrong in doubting my innocence.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious Heaven! and was this too doubted?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not; but the whole race of men, the whole male
sex, wanted and found in me a protector.&nbsp; I shewed her what
I was ready to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, sir, it was for that very thing that she put
the daughter back and herself forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say not so; but thou mayest know as much as
befitteth, by what follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Worshipful lady! honoured
madam!<br />
I at this present truly glad am<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To have so fair an opportunity<br />
Of saying I would be the man<br />
To bind in wedlock Mistress Anne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Living with her in holy unity.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;And for a jointure I will
gi&rsquo;e her<br />
A good two hundred pounds a year<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Accruing from my landed rents,<br />
Whereof see t&rsquo;other paper, telling<br />
Lands, copses, and grown woods for felling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Capons, and cottage tenements.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;And who must come at sound of
horn,<br />
And who pays but a barley-corn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And who is bound to keep a whelp,<br />
And what is brought me for the pound,<br />
And copyholders, which are sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And which do need the leech&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;And you may see in these two
pages<br />
Exact their illnesses and ages,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enough (God willing) to content ye;<br />
Who looks full red, who looks full yellow,<br />
Who plies the mullen, who the mallow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who fails at fifty, who at twenty.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Jim Yates must go; he&rsquo;s one
day very hot,<br />
And one day ice; I take a heriot;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And poorly, poorly&rsquo;s Jacob Burgess.<br />
The doctor tells me he has pour&rsquo;d<br />
Into his stomach half his hoard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of anthelminticals and purges.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Judith, the wife of Ebenezer<br

Fillpots, won&rsquo;t have him long to tease her;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fillpots blows hot and cold like Jim,<br />
And, sleepless lest the boys should plunder<br />
His orchard, he must soon knock under;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Death has been looking out for him.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;He blusters; but his good yard
land<br />
Under the church, his ale-house, and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His Bible, which he cut in spite,<br />
Must all fall in; he stamps and swears<br />
And sets his neighbours by the ears&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fillpots, thy saddle sits not tight!&rsquo;</p>

And all her gainings are gilt pills<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the sick madman that she plundered.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;And the brave lad who sent the

Olive-faced Frenchman (sure enough)<br />

There are twelve groats at once, beside<br />
The frying-pan in which she fried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pancakes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">Madam, I am always,
etc.,</p>
<p style="text-align: right" class="poetry">Sir <span
class="smcap">Thomas Lucy</span>, Knight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did believe that such a clear and conscientious
exposure of my affairs would have brought me a like return.&nbsp;
My letter was sent back to me with small courtesy.&nbsp; It may
be there was no paper in the house, or none equalling mine in
whiteness.&nbsp; No notice was taken of the rent-roll; but
between the second and third stanza these four lines were
written, in a very fine hand:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Most honour&rsquo;d knight, Sir
Thomas! two<br />
For merry Nan will never do;<br />
Now under favour let me say &rsquo;t,<br />
She will bring more herself than that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have reason to believe that the worthy lady did neither
write nor countenance the same, perhaps did not ever know of
them.&nbsp; She always had at her elbow one who jogged it when he
listed, and although he could not overrule the daughter, he took
especial care that none other should remove her from his
tutelage, even when she had fairly grown up to woman&rsquo;s
estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, after all this condescension and confidence,
promise me, good lad, promise that thou wilt not edge and elbow
me.&nbsp; Never let it be said, when people say, <i>Sir Thomas
was a poet when he will edit</i>,&mdash;<i>So is Bill
Shakspeare</i>!&nbsp; It beseemeth not that our names do go
together cheek by jowl in this familiar fashion, like an old
beagle and a whelp, in couples, where if the one would, the other
would not.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, while these thoughts are passing in your mind,
remember there is another pair of couples out of which it would
be as well to keep the cur&rsquo;s neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man! dost thou understand Master
Silas?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But too well.&nbsp; Not those couples in which it might
be apprehended that your worship and my unworthiness should
appear too close together; but those sorrowfuller which
peradventure might unite Master Silas and me in our road to
Warwick and upwards.&nbsp; But I resign all right and title unto
these as willingly as I did unto the other, and am as ready to
let him go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we keep wheeling and wheeling, like a flock of
pigeons, and rising again when we are within a foot of the
ground, we shall never fill the craw.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do thou then question him, Silas.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am none of the quorum; the business is none of
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Sir Thomas took Master Silas again into the bay window,
and said softly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas, he hath no inkling of thy meaning.&nbsp; The
business is a ticklish one.&nbsp; I like not overmuch to meddle
and make therein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Silas stood dissatisfied awhile, and then
answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s mother, sir, was housemaid and
sempstress in your own family, time back, and you thereby have a
right over her unto the third and fourth generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have, Silas,&rdquo; said his worship, &ldquo;but
it was no longer than four or five years agone that folks were
fain to speak maliciously of me for only finding my horse in her
hovel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Silas looked red and shiny as a ripe strawberry on a
Snitterfield tile, and answered somewhat peevishly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same folks, I misgive me, may find the
rogue&rsquo;s there any night in the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereunto replied Sir Thomas, mortifiedly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot think it, Silas!&nbsp; I cannot think
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after some hesitation and disquiet,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I am resolved I will not think it; no man, friend
or enemy, shall push it into me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worshipful sir,&rdquo; answered Master Silas, &ldquo;I
am as resolute as any one in what I would think and what I would
not think, and never was known to fight dunghill in either
cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were he only out of the way, she might do duty, but
what doth she now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She points his young beard for him; persuading him it
grows thicker and thicker, blacker and blacker; she washes his
ruff, stiffens it, plaits it, tries it upon his neck, removes the
hair from under it, pinches it with thumb and fore-finger,
pretending that he hath moiled it, puts her hand all the way
round it, <i>setting it to rights</i>, as she calleth
it&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Sir Thomas! a louder whistle than that will never
call her back again when she is off with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas was angered, and cried tartly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who whistled?&nbsp; I would know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Silas said submissively,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your honour, as wrongfully I fancied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrongfully, indeed, and to my no small disparagement
and discomfort,&rdquo; said the knight, verily believing that he
had not whistled; for deep and dubious were his cogitations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I protest,&rdquo; went he on to say, &ldquo;I protest
it was the wind of the casement; and if I live another year I
will put a better in the place of it.&nbsp; Whistle
indeed&mdash;for what?&nbsp; I care no more about her than about
an unfledged cygnet,&mdash;a child, <a name="citation189a"></a><a
href="#footnote189a" class="citation">[189a]</a> a chicken, a
mere kitten, a crab-blossom in the hedge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dignity of his worship was wounded by Master Silas
unaware, and his wrath again turned suddenly upon poor
William.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark-ye, knave! hark-ye again, ill-looking stripling,
lanky from vicious courses!&nbsp; I will reclaim thee from them;
I will do what thy own father would, and cannot.&nbsp; Thou shalt
follow his business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot do better, may it please your worship!&rdquo;
said the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall lead thee unto wealth and
respectability,&rdquo; said the knight, somewhat appeased by his
ready compliancy and low, gentle voice. &ldquo;Yea, but not
here,&mdash;no witches, no wantons (this word fell gravely and at
full-length upon the ear), no spells hereabout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gloucestershire is within a measured mile of thy
dwelling.&nbsp; There is one at Bristol, formerly a parish-boy,
or little better, who now writeth himself <i>gentleman</i> in
large, round letters, and hath been elected, I hear, to serve as
burgess in parliament for his native city; just as though he had
eaten a capon or turkey-poult in his youth, and had actually been
at grammar school and college.&nbsp; When he began, he had not
credit for a goat-skin; and now, behold ye! this very coat upon
my back did cost me eight shillings the dearer for him, he bought
up wool so largely.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it please your worship! if my father so ordereth, I
go cheerfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art grown discreet and dutiful.&nbsp; I am fain to
command thy release, taking thy promise on oath, and some
reasonable security, that thou wilt abstain and withhold in
future from that idle and silly slut, that sly and scoffing
giggler, Hannah Hathaway, with whom, to the heartache of thy
poor, worthy father, thou wantonly keepest company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then did Sir Thomas ask Master Silas Gough for the Book of
Life, bidding him deliver it into the right hand of Billy, with
an eye upon him that he touch it with both lips,&mdash;it being
taught by the Jesuits, and caught too greedily out of their
society and communion, that whoso toucheth it with one lip only,
and thereafter sweareth falsely, cannot be called a perjurer,
since perjury is breaking an oath.&nbsp; But breaking half an
oath, as he doth who toucheth the Bible or crucifix with one lip
only, is no more perjury than breaking an eggshell is breaking an
egg, the shell being a part, and the egg being an integral.</p>
<p>William did take the Holy Book with all due reverence the
instant it was offered to his hand.&nbsp; His stature seemed to
rise therefrom as from a pulpit, and Sir Thomas was quite
edified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obedient and conducible youth!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See there, Master Silas! what hast thou now to say against
him?&nbsp; Who sees farthest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man from the gallows is the most likely, bating his
nightcap and blinker,&rdquo; said Master Silas, peevishly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He hath not outwitted me yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seized upon the Anchor of Faith like a
martyr,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, &ldquo;and even now his face
burns red as elder-wine before the gossips.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I await the further orders of your worship from the
chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I return and seat myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then did Sir Thomas say with great complacency and
satisfaction in the ear of Master Silas,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What civility, and deference, and sedateness of mind,
Silas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Master Silas answered not.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">William
Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I swear, sirs?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, swear; be of good courage.&nbsp; I protest to thee
by my honour and knighthood, no ill shall come unto thee
therefrom.&nbsp; Thou shalt not be circumvented in thy simpleness
and inexperience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willy, having taken the Book of Life, did kiss it piously, and
did press it unto his breast, saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tenderest love is the growth of my heart, as the grass
is of Alvescote mead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I lose my life or my friends, or my memory, or my
reason; may I be viler in my own eyes than those men
are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he was interrupted, most lovingly, by Sir Thomas, who
said unto him,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, nay! poor youth! do not tell me so! they are
not such very bad men, since thou appealest unto
C&aelig;sar,&mdash;that is, unto the judgment-seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now his worship did mean the two witnesses, Joseph and Euseby;
and, sooth to say there be many worse.&nbsp; But William had them
not in his eye; his thoughts were elsewhere, as will be evident,
for he went on thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;if ever I forget or desert thee, or ever cease
to worship <a name="citation193a"></a><a href="#footnote193a"
class="citation">[193a]</a> and cherish thee, my
Hannah!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The madman! the audacious, desperate, outrageous
villain!&nbsp; Look-ye, sir! where he flung the Holy
Gospel!&nbsp; Behold it on the holly and box boughs in the
chimney-place, spreaden all abroad, like a lad about to be
whipped!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miscreant knave!&nbsp; I will send after him
forthwith!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, there! is the caitiff at hand, or running
off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonas Greenfield the butler did budge forward after a while,
and say, on being questioned,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, that was he!&nbsp; Was his nag tied to the iron
gate at the lodge, Master Silas?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I know about a thief&rsquo;s nag, Jonas
Greenfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And didst thou let him go, Jonas,&mdash;even
thou?&rdquo; said Sir Thomas.&nbsp; &ldquo;What! are none found
faithful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord love your worship,&rdquo; said Jonas Greenfield;
&ldquo;a man of threescore and two may miss catching a kite upon
wing.&nbsp; Fleetness doth not make folks the faithfuller, or
that youth yonder beats us all in faithfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! he darts on like a greyhound whelp after a
leveret.&nbsp; He, sure enough, it was!&nbsp; I now remember the
sorrel mare his father bought of John Kinderley last Lammas,
swift as he threaded the trees along the park.&nbsp; He must have
reached Wellesbourne ere now at that gallop, and pretty nigh
Walton-hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merciful Christ! grant the country be rid of him for
ever!&nbsp; What dishonour upon his friends and native
town!&nbsp; A reputable wool-stapler&rsquo;s son turned gipsy and
poet for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Silas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Beelzebub; he spake as bigly and fiercely as a soaken
yeoman at an election feast,&mdash;this obedient and conducible
youth!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sir
Thomas</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so written.&nbsp; Hold thy peace,
Silas!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>POST-SCRIPTUM<br />
BY ME, EPHRAIM BARNETT.</h3>
<p>Twelve days are over and gone since William Shakspeare did
leave our parts.&nbsp; And the spinster, Hannah Hathaway, is in
sad doleful plight about him; forasmuch as Master Silas Cough
went yesterday unto her, in her mother&rsquo;s house at Shottery,
and did desire both her and her mother to take heed and be
admonished, that if ever she, Hannah, threw away one thought
after the runagate William Shakspeare, he should swing.</p>
<p>The girl could do nothing but weep; while as the mother did
give her solemn promise that her daughter should never more think
about him all her natural life, reckoning from the moment of this
her promise.</p>
<p>And the maiden, now growing more reasonable, did promise the
same.&nbsp; But Master Silas said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I doubt you will</i>, <i>though</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;<i>I answer
for her she shall not think of him</i>, <i>even if she see his
ghost</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannah screamed, and swooned, the better to forget him.&nbsp;
And Master Silas went home easier and contenteder.&nbsp; For now
all the worst of his hard duty was accomplished,&mdash;he having
been, on the Wednesday of last week, at the speech of Master John
Shakspeare, Will&rsquo;s father, to inquire whether the sorrel
mare was his.&nbsp; To which question the said Master John
Shakspeare did answer, &ldquo;<i>Yea</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Enough said</i>!&rdquo; rejoined Master Silas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Horse-stealing is capital</i>.&nbsp; <i>We shall
bind thee over to appear against the culprit</i>, <i>as
prosecutor</i>, <i>at the next assizes</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May the Lord in his mercy give the lad a good deliverance, if
so be it be no sin to wish it!</p>

<h3><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>PREFACE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the same worthy man who
preserved the <i>Examination of Shakspeare</i>, we are indebted
for what he entitles on the cover, <i>A Conference of Master
Edmund Spenser</i>, <i>etc.</i>, <i>with the Earl of
Essex</i>.&nbsp; It must be confessed that this Conference throws
little light upon the great rebellion of Ireland.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, there are some curious minds, which perhaps may
take an interest in the conversation of two illustrious men, one
distinguished by his genius, the other by the favour of his
sovereign.&nbsp; The Editor, it will be perceived, is but little
practised in the ways of literature; much less is he gifted with
that prophetic spirit which can anticipate the judgment of the
public.&nbsp; It may be that he is too idle or too apathetic to
think anxiously or much about the matter; and yet he has been
amused, in his earlier days, at watching the first appearance of
such few books as he believed to be the production of some
powerful <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>intellect.&nbsp; He has seen people slowly rise up to
them, like carp in a pond when food is thrown among them; some of
which carp snatch suddenly at a morsel, and swallow it; others
touch it gently with their barbe, pass deliberately by, and leave
it; others wriggle and rub against it more disdainfully; others,
in sober truth, know not what to make of it, swim round and round
it, eye it on the sunny side, eye it on the shady, approach it,
question it, shoulder it, flap it with the tail, turn it over,
look askance at it, take a pea-shell or a worm instead of it, and
plunge again their contented heads into the comfortable mud;
after some seasons the same food will suit their stomachs
better.</p>
<p>The Editor has seen all this, and been an actor in it, whether
at Chantilly or Fontainebleau is indifferent to the reader; and
it has occurred to him that Shakspeare and Spenser were thrown

first) after many years.&nbsp; He is certain that these two
publications can interest only the antiquary and biographer;

a man as Ephraim Barnett, with no peculiar zeal for genius, and
with no other scope or intention than a lesson for his
descendants, has preserved an authentic memorial of the principal
event both in the life of Shakspeare and of Spenser; the one
event was very near the cause of terminating Shakspeare&rsquo;s,
the other did terminate Spenser&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He accounts for
his knowledge of the facts naturally enough, as those will
readily admit who have the patience to read his paper on the

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Instantly</span> on hearing of thy
arrival from Ireland I sent a message to thee, good Edmund, that
I might learn from one so judicious and dispassionate as thou
art, the real state of things in that distracted
country,&mdash;it having pleased the queen&rsquo;s majesty to
think of appointing me her deputy, in order to bring the
rebellious to submission.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Spenser</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisely and well considered; but more worthily of her
judgment than her affection.&nbsp; May your lordship overcome, as
you have ever done, the difficulties and dangers you
foresee.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Essex</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We grow weak by striking at random; and knowing that I
must strike, and strike heavily, I would fain see exactly where
the stroke shall fall.</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>&ldquo;Some attribute to the Irish all sorts of
excesses; others tell us that these are old stories; that there
is not a more inoffensive race of merry creatures under heaven,
and that their crimes are all hatched for them here in England,
by the incubation of printers&rsquo; boys, and are brought to
market at times of distressing dearth in news.&nbsp; From all
that I myself have seen of them, I can only say that the
civilized (I mean the richer and titled) are as susceptible of
heat as iron, and as impenetrable to light as granite.&nbsp; The
half-barbarous are probably worse; the utterly barbarous may be
somewhat better.&nbsp; Like game-cocks, they must spur when they
meet.&nbsp; One fights because he fights an Englishman; another
because the fellow he quarrels with comes from a distant county;
a third because the next parish is an eyesore to him, and his
fist-mate is from it.&nbsp; The only thing in which they all
agree as proper law is the tooth-for-tooth act.&nbsp; Luckily we
have a bishop who is a native, and we called him before the
queen.&nbsp; He represented to her majesty that every thing in
Old Ireland tended to re-produce its kind,&mdash;crimes among
others; and he declared, frankly, that if an honest man is
murdered, or what is dearer to an honest man, if his honour is
wounded in the person of his wife, it must be <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>expected
that he will retaliate.&nbsp; Her Majesty delivered it as her
opinion that the latter case of vindictiveness was more likely to
take effect than the former.&nbsp; But the bishop replied that in
his conscience he could not answer for either if the man was
up.&nbsp; The dean of the same diocese gave us a more favorable
report.&nbsp; Being a justice of the peace, he averred most
solemnly that no man ever had complained to him of murder,
excepting one who had lost so many fore-teeth by a cudgel that
his deposition could not be taken exactly,&mdash;added to which,
his head was a little clouded with drunkenness; furthermore, that
extremely few women had adduced sufficiently clear proofs of
violence, excepting those who were wilful and resisted with tooth
and nail.&nbsp; In all which cases it was difficult, nay
impossible, to ascertain which violence began first and lasted
longest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not a nation upon earth that pretends to be so
superlatively generous and high-minded; and there is not one (I
speak from experience) so utterly base and venal.&nbsp; I have
positive proof that the nobility, in a mass, are agreed to sell,
for a stipulated sum, all their rights and privileges, so much
per man; and the queen is inclined thereunto.&nbsp; But would our
parliament consent to pay money for a <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>cargo of rotten pilchards?&nbsp; And
would not our captains be readier to swamp than to import
them?&nbsp; The noisiest rogues in that kingdom, if not quieted
by a halter, may be quieted by making them brief-collectors, and
by allowing them first to encourage the incendiary, then to
denounce and hang him, and lastly to collect all the money they
can, running up and down with the whining ferocity of
half-starved hyenas, under pretence of repairing the damages
their exhausted country hath sustained.&nbsp; Others ask modestly
a few thousands a year, and no more, from those whom they
represent to us as naked and famished; and prove clearly to every
dispassionate man who hath a single drop of free blood in his
veins that at least this pittance is due to them for abandoning
their liberal and lucrative professions, and for endangering
their valuable lives on the tempestuous seas, in order that the
voice of Truth may sound for once upon the shores of England, and
Humanity cast her shadow on the council-chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave a dinner to a party of these fellows a few weeks
ago.&nbsp; I know not how many kings and princes were amongst
them, nor how many poets, and prophets, and legislators, and
sages.&nbsp; When they were half-drunk, they coaxed and
threatened; when they had gone <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>somewhat deeper, they joked, and
croaked, and hiccoughed, and wept over sweet Ireland; and when
they could neither stand nor sit any longer, they fell upon their
knees and their noddles, and swore that limbs, life, liberty,
Ireland, and God himself, were all at the queen&rsquo;s
service.&nbsp; It was only their holy religion, the religion of
their forefathers&mdash;&nbsp; Here sobs interrupted some, howls
others, execrations more, and the liquor they had ingulfed, the
rest.&nbsp; I looked down on them with stupor and astonishment,
seeing faces, forms, dresses, much like ours, and recollecting
their ignorance, levity, and ferocity.&nbsp; My pages drew them
gently by the heels down the steps; my grooms set them upright
(inasmuch as might be) on their horses; and the people in the
streets, shouting and pelting, sent forward the beasts to their
straw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Various plans have been laid before us for civilising
or coercing them.&nbsp; Among the pacific, it was proposed to
make an offer to five-hundred of the richer Jews in the
Hanse-towns and in Poland, who should be raised to the dignity of
the Irish peerage, and endowed with four thousand acres of good
forfeited land, on condition of each paying two thousand pounds,
and of keeping up ten horsemen and twenty foot, Germans or Poles,
in readiness for service.</p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>&ldquo;The Catholics bear no where such ill-will toward
Jews as toward Protestants.&nbsp; Brooks make even worse
neighbours than oceans do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I myself saw no objection to the measure; but our
gracious queen declared she had an insuperable one&mdash;<i>they
stank</i>!&nbsp; We all acknowledged the strength of the
argument, and took out our handkerchiefs.&nbsp; Lord Burleigh
almost fainted; and Raleigh wondered how the Emperor Titus could
bring up his men against Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said he, looking reverentially at her
Majesty, &lsquo;the star of Berenice shone above him! and what
evil influence could that star not quell? what malignancy could
it not annihilate?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hereupon he touched the earth with his brow, until the
queen said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir Walter! lift me up those laurels.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At which manifestation of princely goodwill he was
advancing to kiss her Majesty&rsquo;s hand, but she waved it, and
said, sharply,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stand there, dog!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what tale have you for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Spenser</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interrogate me, my lord, that I may answer each
question distinctly, my mind being <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>in sad confusion at what I have seen
and undergone.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Essex</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me thy account and opinion of these very affairs
as thou leftest them; for I would rather know one part well than
all imperfectly; and the violences of which I have heard within
the day surpass belief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why weepest thou, my gentle Spenser?&nbsp; Have the
rebels sacked thy house?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Spenser</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have plundered and utterly destroyed
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p>&ldquo;I grieve for thee, and will see thee
righted.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Spenser</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this they have little harmed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p>&ldquo;Howl I have heard it reported that thy grounds are
fertile and thy mansion <a name="citation211"></a><a

<p>&ldquo;If river, and lake, and meadow-ground, and mountain,
could render any place the abode of pleasantness, pleasant was
mine, indeed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the lovely banks of Mulla I found deep
contentment.&nbsp; Under the dark alders did I muse and
meditate.&nbsp; Innocent hopes were my gravest cares, and my
playfullest fancy was with kindly wishes.&nbsp; Ah! surely, of
all cruelties the worst is to extinguish our kindness.&nbsp; Mine
is gone: I love the people and the land no longer.&nbsp; My lord,
ask me not about them; I may speak injuriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Essex</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think rather, then, of thy happier hours and busier
occupations; these likewise may instruct me.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Spenser</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first seeds I sowed in the garden, ere the old
castle was made habitable for my lovely bride, were acorns from
Penshurst.&nbsp; I planted a little oak before my mansion at the
birth of each child.&nbsp; &lsquo;My sons,&rsquo; I said to
myself, &lsquo;shall often play in the shade of them when I am
gone, and every year shall they take the measure of their growth,
as fondly as I take theirs.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well; but let not this thought make thee weep so
bitterly.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Spenser</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poison may ooze from beautiful plants; deadly grief
from dearest reminiscences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>must</i> grieve, I <i>must</i> weep; it seems the
law of God, and the only one that men are not disposed to
contravene.&nbsp; In the performance of this alone do they
effectually aid one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Essex</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spenser!&nbsp; I wish I had at hand any arguments or
persuasions of force sufficient to remove thy sorrow; but really
I am not in the habit of seeing men grieve at any thing except
the loss of favour at court, or of a hawk, or of a
buck-hound.&nbsp; And were I to swear out my condolences to a man
of thy discernment, in the same round, roll-call phrases we
employ with one another upon these occasions, I should be guilty,
not of insincerity, but of insolence.&nbsp; True grief hath ever
something sacred in it, and when it visiteth a wise man and a
brave one, is most holy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, kiss not my hand; he whom God <a

hath God with him.&nbsp; In his presence what am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p>&ldquo;Never so great, my lord, as at this hour, when you see
aright who is greater.&nbsp; May He guide your counsels, and
preserve your life and glory!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are thy friends?&nbsp; Are they with
thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p>&ldquo;Ah, where indeed?&nbsp; Generous, true-hearted Philip!
where art thou? whose presence was unto me peace and safety,
whose smile was contentment, and whose praise renown.&nbsp; My
lord! I cannot but think of him among still heavier losses; he
was my earliest friend, and would have taught me
wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Essex</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pastoral poetry, my dear Spenser, doth not require
tears and lamentations.&nbsp; Dry thine eyes; rebuild thine
house.&nbsp; The queen and council, I venture to promise thee,
will make ample amends for every evil thou hast sustained.&nbsp;
What! does that enforce thee to wail yet louder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will see that!&nbsp; There are other swords, and
other arms to wield them, besides a Leicester&rsquo;s and a

their friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p>&ldquo;O my sweet child!&nbsp; And of many so powerful, many
so wise and so beneficent, was there none to save thee?&nbsp;
None! none!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p>&ldquo;I now perceive that thou lamentest what almost every

although the payment may be delayed.&nbsp; Consider; the same

altars of God himself, are asylums against death.&nbsp; How do I
know but under this very roof there may sleep some latent
calamity, that in an instant shall cover <a

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, no!&nbsp; Calamities there are around us;
calamities there are all over the earth; calamities there are in

gateway, or the embayed window, and on the happy pair that haply
is toying at it; nevertheless, thou mayest say that of a

chambers, and heard many wailings; and each time this was the
heaviest stroke of all.&nbsp; Funerals have passed along through
the stout-hearted <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

</blockquote>
<p>My kinsman, Jacob Eldridge, having been taught by me, among
other useful things, to write a fair and laudable hand, was
recommended and introduced by our worthy townsman, Master Thomas
Greene, unto the Earl of Essex, to keep his accounts, and to
write down sundry matters from his dictation, even letters
occasionally.&nbsp; For although our nobility, very unlike the
French, not only can read and write, but often do, yet some from
generosity, and some from dignity, keep in their employment what
those who are illiterate, and would not appear so, call an
<i>amanuensis</i>, thereby meaning <i>secretary</i> or
<i>scribe</i>.&nbsp; Now it happened that our gracious
queen&rsquo;s highness was desirous of knowing all that could be
known about the Rebellion in Ireland; and hearing but little
truth from her nobility in that country, even the fathers in God
inclining more unto court favour than will be readily believed of
spiritual lords, and moulding <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>their ductile depositions on the
pasteboard of their temporal mistress, until she was angry at
seeing the lawn-sleeves so besmirched from wrist to elbow, she
herself did say unto the Earl of Essex,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Essex! these fellows lie!&nbsp; I am inclined to
unfrock and scourge them sorely for their leasings.&nbsp; Of that
anon.&nbsp; Find out, if you can, somebody who hath his wit and
his honesty about him at the same time.&nbsp; I know that when
one of these paniers is full the other is apt to be empty, and
that men walk crookedly for want of balance.&nbsp; No
matter&mdash;we must search and find.&nbsp; Persuade&mdash;thou
canst persuade, Essex!&mdash;say any thing, do any thing.&nbsp;
We must talk gold and give&mdash;iron.&nbsp; Dost understand
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The earl did kiss the jewels upon the dread fingers, for only
the last joint of each is visible; and surely no mortal was ever
so foolhardy as to take such a monstrous liberty as touching it,
except in spirit!&nbsp; On the next day there did arrive many
fugitives from Ireland; and among the rest was Master Edmund
Spenser, known even in those parts for his rich vein of poetry,
in which he is declared by our best judges to excel the noblest
of the ancients, and to leave all the moderns at his feet.&nbsp;
Whether he notified his <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>arrival unto the earl, or whether
fame brought the notice thereof unto his lordship, Jacob knoweth
not.&nbsp; But early in the morrow did the earl send for Jacob,
and say unto him,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eldridge! thou must write fairly and clearly out, and
in somewhat large letters, and in lines somewhat wide apart, all
that thou hearest of the conversation I shall hold with a
gentleman from Ireland.&nbsp; Take this gilt and illumined
vellum, and albeit the civet make thee sick fifty times, write
upon it all that passes!&nbsp; Come not out of the closet until
the gentleman hath gone homeward.&nbsp; The queen requireth much
exactness; and this is equally a man of genius, a man of
business, and a man of worth.&nbsp; I expect from him not only
what is true, but what is the most important and necessary to
understand rightly and completely; and nobody in existence is
more capable of giving me both information and advice.&nbsp;
Perhaps if he thought another were within hearing he would be
offended or over-cautious.&nbsp; His delicacy and mine are
warranted safe and sound by the observance of those commands
which I am delivering unto thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened that no information was given in this conference
relating to the movements or designs of the rebels.&nbsp; So that
Master Jacob Eldridge was left possessor of the costly vellum, <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>which, now
Master Spenser is departed this life, I keep as a memorial of
him, albeit oftener than once I have taken pounce box and
penknife in hand, in order to make it a fit and proper vehicle
for my own very best writing.&nbsp; But I pretermitted it,
finding that my hand is no longer the hand it was, or rather that
the breed of geese is very much degenerated, and that their
quills, like men&rsquo;s manners, are grown softer and
flaccider.&nbsp; Where it will end God only knows; I shall not
live to see it.</p>
<p>Alas, poor Jacob Eldridge! he little thought that within
twelve months his glorious master, and the scarcely less glorious
poet, would be no more!&nbsp; In the third week of the following
year was Master Edmund buried at the charges of the earl; and
within these few days hath this lofty nobleman bowed his head
under the axe of God&rsquo;s displeasure,&mdash;such being our
gracious queen&rsquo;s.&nbsp; My kinsman Jacob sent unto me by
the Alcester drover, old Clem Fisher, this, among other papers,
fearing the wrath of that offended highness which allowed not her
own sweet disposition to question or thwart the will
divine.&nbsp; Jacob did likewise tell me in his letter that he
was sure I should be happy to hear the success of William
Shakspeare, our townsman.&nbsp; And in truth right glad was I to
hear of it, being <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>a principal in bringing it about, as those several
sheets will shew which have the broken tile laid upon them to
keep them down compactly.</p>
<p>Jacob&rsquo;s words are these:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I speak of poets, you will be in a maze at hearing
that our townsman hath written a power of matter for the
playhouse.&nbsp; Neither he nor the booksellers think it quite
good enough to print; but I do assure you, on the faith of a
Christian, it is not bad; and there is rare fun in the last thing
of his about Venus, where a Jew, one Shiloh, is choused out of
his money and his revenge.&nbsp; However, the best critics and
the greatest lords find fault, and very justly, in the
words,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew
hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same
diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same
winter and summer, as a Christian is?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, this is very unchristianlike.&nbsp; Nay, for
supposition sake, suppose it to be true, was it his business to
tell the people so?&nbsp; Was it his duty to ring the
crier&rsquo;s bell and cry to them, <i>The sorry Jews are quite
as much men as you are</i>?&nbsp; The impudentest thing
(excepting some bauderies) that ever came from the stage!&nbsp;
The church, luckily, has let him alone for the <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>present;
and the queen winks upon it.&nbsp; The best defence he can make
for himself is that it comes from the mouth of a Jew, who says
many other things as abominable.&nbsp; Master Greene may overrate
him; but Master Greene declares that if William goes on improving
and taking his advice, it will be desperate hard work in another
seven years to find so many as half a dozen chaps equal to him
within the liberties.&nbsp; Master Greene and myself took him
with us to see the burial of Master Edmund Spenser in Westminster
Abbey, on the 19th of January last.&nbsp; The halberdmen pushed
us back as having no business there.&nbsp; Master Greene told
them he belonged to the queen&rsquo;s company of players.&nbsp;
William Shakspeare could have said the same, but did not.&nbsp;
And I, fearing that Master Greene and he might be halberded back
into the crowd, shewed the badge of the Earl of Essex.&nbsp;
Whereupon did the serjeant ground his halberd, and say unto
me,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That badge commands admittance everywhere; your
folk likewise may come in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Greene was red-hot angry, and told me he would
bring him before the <i>council</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;William smiled, and Master Greene said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why! would not you, if you were in my
place?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>&ldquo;He replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am an half inclined to do worse,&mdash;to
bring him before the <i>audience</i> some spare hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the close of the burial-service all the poets of the
age threw their pens into the grave, together with the pieces
they had composed in praise or lamentation of the deceased.&nbsp;
William Shakspeare was the only poet who abstained from throwing
in either pen or poem,&mdash;at which no one marvelled, he being
of low estate, and the others not having yet taken him by the
hand.&nbsp; Yet many authors recognised him, not indeed as
author, but as player; and one, civiller than the rest, came up
unto him triumphantly, his eyes sparkling with glee and
satisfaction, and said, consolatorily,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In due time, my honest friend, you may be
admitted to do as much for one of us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After such encouragement,&rsquo; replied our
townsman, &lsquo;I am bound in duty to give you the preference,
should I indeed be worthy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This was the only smart thing he uttered all the
remainder of the day; during the whole of it he appeared to be
half-lost, I know not whether in melancholy or in meditation, and
soon left us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here endeth all that my kinsman Jacob wrote <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>about
William Shakspeare, saving and excepting his excuse for having
written so much.&nbsp; The rest of his letter was on a matter of
wider and weightier import, namely, on the price of Cotteswolde
cheese at Evesham fair.&nbsp; And yet, although ingenious men be
not among the necessaries of life, there is something in them
that makes us curious in regard to their goings and doings.&nbsp;
It were to be wished that some of them had attempted to be better
accountants; and others do appear to have laid aside the copybook
full early in the day.&nbsp; Nevertheless, they have their uses
and their merits.&nbsp; Master Eldridge&rsquo;s letter is the
wrapper of much wholesome food for contemplation.&nbsp; Although
the decease (within so brief a period) of such a poet as Master
Spenser, and such a patron as the earl, be unto us appalling, we
laud and magnify the great Disposer of events, no less for his
goodness in raising the humble than for his power in
extinguishing the great.&nbsp; And peradventure ye, my heirs and
descendants, who shall read with due attention what my pen now
writeth, will say, with the royal Psalmist, that it inditeth of a
good matter, when it sheweth unto you that, whereas it pleased
the queen&rsquo;s highness to send a great lord before the
judgment-seat of Heaven, having fitted him by <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>means of
such earthly instruments as princes in like cases do usually
employ, and deeming (no doubt) in her princely heart that by such
shrewd tonsure his head would be best fitted for a crown of
glory, and thus doing all that she did out of the purest and most
considerate love for him,&mdash;it likewise hath pleased her
highness to use her right hand as freely as her left, and to
raise up a second burgess of our town to be one of her company of
players.&nbsp; And ye, also, by industry and loyalty, may
cheerfully hope for promotion in your callings, and come up (some
of you) as nearly to him in the presence of royalty, as he cometh
up (far off, indeed, at present) to the great and wonderful poet
who lies dead among more spices than any ph&oelig;nix, and more
quills than any porcupine.&nbsp; If this thought may not prick
and incitate you, little is to be hoped from any gentle
admonition, or any earnest expostulation, of</p>

illegible.&nbsp; It appears to have some reference to the

outlandish is apparent from the reprimand of Sir Thomas.</p>
<p><a name="footnote29a"></a><a href="#citation29a"

appear that Shakspeare had formed the idea, if not the outline,
of several plays already, much as he altered them, no doubt, in
after life.</p>
<p><a name="footnote38a"></a><a href="#citation38a"
class="footnote">[38a]</a>&nbsp; The greater part of the value of
the present work arises from the certain information it affords
us on the price of small needles in the reign of Elizabeth.&nbsp;
Fine needles in her days were made only at Liege, and some few
cities in the Netherlands, and may be reckoned among those things
which were much dearer than they are now.</p>
<p><a name="footnote39b"></a><a href="#citation39b"

his <i>Pantheon</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote44a"></a><a href="#citation44a"
class="footnote">[44a]</a>&nbsp; This was really the case within
our memory.</p>
<p><a name="footnote45a"></a><a href="#citation45a"
class="footnote">[45a]</a>&nbsp; It was formerly thought, and
perhaps is thought still, that the hand of a man recently hanged,
being rubbed on the tumour of the king&rsquo;s evil, was able to
cure it.&nbsp; The crown and the gallows divided the glory of the
sovereign remedy.</p>
<p><a name="footnote46a"></a><a href="#citation46a"
class="footnote">[46a]</a>&nbsp; And yet he never did sail any
farther than into Bohemia.</p>

the female dress, corresponding with <i>shroud</i>, or what we
now call (or lately called) <i>shirt</i> of the
man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Fox, speaking of Latimer&rsquo;s burning,
says, &ldquo;Being slipped into his <i>shroud</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote50b"></a><a href="#citation50b"
class="footnote">[50b]</a>&nbsp; Faith nailing the ears is a
strong and sacred metaphor.&nbsp; The rhyme is
imperfect,&mdash;Shakspeare was not always attentive to these
minor beauties.</p>
<p><a name="footnote53a"></a><a href="#citation53a"
class="footnote">[53a]</a>&nbsp; Shakspeare seems to have
profited afterward by this metaphor, even more perhaps than by
all the direct pieces of instruction in poetry given him so
handsomely by the worthy knight.&nbsp; And here it may be
permitted the editor to profit also by the manuscript, correcting
in Shakspeare what is absolute nonsense as now
printed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Vaulting</i> ambition that
o&rsquo;erleaps <i>itself</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be its <i>sell</i>.&nbsp; <i>Sell</i> is
<i>saddle</i> in Spenser and elsewhere, from the Latin and
Italian.</p>
<p>This emendation was shewn to the late Mr. Hazlitt, an acute
man at least, who expressed his conviction that it was the right
reading, and added somewhat more in approbation of it.</p>
<p><a name="footnote55a"></a><a href="#citation55a"
class="footnote">[55a]</a>&nbsp; It has been suggested that this
answer was borrowed from Virgil, and goes strongly against the
genuineness of the manuscript.&nbsp; The Editor&rsquo;s memory
was upon the stretch to recollect the words; the learned critic
supplied them:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Solum &AElig;neas vocat: <i>et vocet</i>,
oro.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Editor could only reply, indeed weakly, that
<i>calling</i> and <i>waiting</i> are not exactly the same,
unless when tradesmen rap and gentlemen are leaving town.</p>
<p><a name="footnote66a"></a><a href="#citation66a"
class="footnote">[66a]</a>&nbsp; Here the manuscript is blotted;
but the probability is that it was <i>fishmonger</i>, rather than
<i>ironmonger</i>, fishmongers having always been notorious
cheats and liars.</p>
<p><a name="footnote70a"></a><a href="#citation70a"
class="footnote">[70a]</a>&nbsp; <i>On the nail</i> appears to be
intended to express <i>ready payment</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote72a"></a><a href="#citation72a"
class="footnote">[72a]</a>&nbsp; The Cordilleras are mountains,
we know, running through South America.&nbsp; Perhaps a pun was
intended; or possibly it might, in the age of Elizabeth, have
been a vulgar term for <i>hanging</i>, although we find no trace
of the expression in other books.&nbsp; We have no clue to guide
us here.&nbsp; It might be suggested that Shakspeare, who shines
little in geographical knowledge, fancied the Cordilleras to
extend into North America, had convicts in his time been
transported to those colonies.&nbsp; Certainly, many adventurers
and desperate men went thither.</p>
<p><a name="footnote89a"></a><a href="#citation89a"
class="footnote">[89a]</a>&nbsp; In that age there was prevalent
a sort of cholera, on which Fracastorius, half a century before,
wrote a Latin poem, employing the graceful nymphs of Homer and
Hesiod, somewhat disguised, in the drudgery of pounding certain
barks and minerals.&nbsp; An article in the Impeachment of
Cardinal Wolsey accuses him of breathing in the king&rsquo;s
face, knowing that he was affected with this cholera.&nbsp; It
was a great assistant to the Reformation, by removing some of the
most vigorous champions that opposed it.&nbsp; In the Holy
College it was followed by the <i>sweating sickness</i>, which
thinned it very sorely; and several even of God&rsquo;s
vicegerents were laid under tribulation by it.&nbsp; Among the
chambers of the Vatican it hung for ages, and it crowned the
labours of Pope Leo XII., of blessed memory, with a crown
somewhat uneasy.</p>
<p><a name="footnote105a"></a><a href="#citation105a"
class="footnote">[105a]</a>&nbsp; Sir Thomas seems to have been
jealous of these two towers, certainly the finest in
England.&nbsp; If Warwick Castle could borrow the windows from
Kenilworth, it would be complete.&nbsp; The knight is not very
courteous on its hospitality.&nbsp; He may, perhaps, have
experienced it, as Garrick and Quin did under the present
occupant&rsquo;s grandfather, on whom the title of Earl of
Warwick was conferred for the eminent services he had rendered to
his country as one of the lords of the bedchamber to his Majesty
George the Second.&nbsp; The verses of Garrick on his invitation
and visit are remembered by many.&nbsp; Quin&rsquo;s are less
known.</p>
<p class="poetry">He shewed us Guy&rsquo;s pot, but the soup he
forgot;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a meal did his lordship allow,<br />
Unless we gnaw&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the blade-bone of the boar,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the rib of the famous <i>Dun Cow</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">When Nevile the great Earl of Warwick lived
here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Three oxen for breakfast were slain,<br />
And strangers invited to sports and good cheer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And invited again and again.</p>
<p class="poetry">This earl is in purse or in spirit so low,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he with no oxen will feed &rsquo;em;<br />
And all of the former great doings we know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is, he gives us a book and we read &rsquo;em.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Garrick</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Stale</i> peers are but tough morsels, and
&rsquo;t were well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If we had found the <i>fresh</i> more eatable;<br />
Garrick!&nbsp; I do not say &rsquo;t were well for <i>him</i>,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For we had pluck&rsquo;d the plover limb from
limb.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Quin</span>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote106a"></a><a href="#citation106a"
class="footnote">[106a]</a>&nbsp; Another untoward blot! but
leaving no doubt of the word.&nbsp; The only doubt is whether he
meant the <i>muzzle</i> of the animal itself, or one of those
leathern muzzles which are often employed to coerce the violence
of ferocious animals.&nbsp; In besieged cities men have been
reduced to such extremities.&nbsp; But the <i>muzzle</i>, in this
place, we suspect, would more properly be called the
<i>blinker</i>, which is often put upon bulls in pastures when
they are vicious.</p>
<p><a name="footnote108a"></a><a href="#citation108a"
class="footnote">[108a]</a>&nbsp; This would countenance the
opinion of those who are inclined to believe that Shakspeare was
a Roman Catholic.&nbsp; His hatred and contempt of priests, which
are demonstrated wherever he has introduced them, may have
originated from the unfairness of Silas Gough.&nbsp; Nothing of
that kind, we may believe, had occurred to him from friars and
monks, whom he treats respectfully and kindly, perhaps in return
for some such services to himself as Friar Lawrence had bestowed
on Romeo,&mdash;or rather less; for Shakspeare was
grateful.&nbsp; The words quoted by him from some sermon, now
lost, prove him no friend to the filchings and swindling of
popery.</p>
<p><a name="footnote111a"></a><a href="#citation111a"
class="footnote">[111a]</a>&nbsp; It is a pity that the old
divines should have indulged, as they often did, in such images
as this.&nbsp; Some readers in search of argumentative subtility,
some in search of sound Christianity, some in search of pure
English undefiled, have gone through with them; and their labours
(however heavy) have been well repaid.</p>
<p><a name="footnote124a"></a><a href="#citation124a"
class="footnote">[124a]</a>&nbsp; <i>Tilley valley</i> was the
favourite adjuration of James the Second.&nbsp; It appears in the
comedies of Shakspeare.</p>
<p><a name="footnote133a"></a><a href="#citation133a"
class="footnote">[133a]</a>&nbsp; <i>Whoreson</i>, if we may
hazard a conjecture, means the son of a woman of
ill-repute.&nbsp; In this we are borne out by the context.&nbsp;
It appears to have escaped the commentators on Shakspeare.</p>
<p><i>Whoreson</i>, a word of frequent occurrence in the
comedies; more rarely found in the tragedies.&nbsp; Although now
obsolete, the expression proves that there were (or were believed
to be) such persons formerly.</p>
<p>The Editor is indebted to two learned friends for these two
remarks, which appear no less just than ingenious.</p>
<p><a name="footnote153a"></a><a href="#citation153a"
class="footnote">[153a]</a>&nbsp; <i>Belly-ache</i>, a disorder
once not uncommon in England.&nbsp; Even the name is now almost
forgotten; yet the elder of us may remember at least the report
of it, and some, perhaps, even the complaint itself, in our
school-days.&nbsp; It usually broke out about the cherry season;
and in some cases made its appearance again at the first
nutting.</p>
<p><a name="footnote157a"></a><a href="#citation157a"
class="footnote">[157a]</a>&nbsp; Sir Thomas borrowed this
expression from Spenser, who thus calls Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p><a name="footnote159a"></a><a href="#citation159a"

<p><a name="footnote164a"></a><a href="#citation164a"

<p><a name="footnote181a"></a><a href="#citation181a"

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
